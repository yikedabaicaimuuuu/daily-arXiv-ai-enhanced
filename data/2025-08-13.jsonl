Accepted by SIGGRAPH 2025 as Conference Paper", "summary": "Indoor lighting estimation from a single image or video remains a challenge\ndue to its highly ill-posed nature, especially when the lighting condition of\nthe scene varies spatially and temporally. We propose a method that estimates\nfrom an input video a continuous light field describing the spatiotemporally\nvarying lighting of the scene. We leverage 2D diffusion priors for optimizing\nsuch light field represented as a MLP. To enable zero-shot generalization to\nin-the-wild scenes, we fine-tune a pre-trained image diffusion model to predict\nlighting at multiple locations by jointly inpainting multiple chrome balls as\nlight probes. We evaluate our method on indoor lighting estimation from a\nsingle image or video and show superior performance over compared baselines.\nMost importantly, we highlight results on spatiotemporally consistent lighting\nestimation from in-the-wild videos, which is rarely demonstrated in previous\nworks."}

We remove the difficulties associated with identifying and\nretargeting the semantics of one rig framework to another by utilizing the same\nframework (3DMM, FLAME, MetaHuman, etc.) for both subjects. Although this does\nnot constrain the choice of framework when retargeting from one person to\nanother, it does force the tracker to use the game/VR character rig when\nretargeting to a game/VR character. We utilize volumetric morphing in order to\nfit facial rigs to both performers and targets; in addition, a carefully chosen\nset of Simon-Says expressions is used to calibrate each rig to the motion\nsignatures of the relevant performer or target. Although a uniform set of\nSimon-Says expressions can likely be used for all person to person retargeting,\nwe argue that person to game/VR character retargeting benefits from Simon-Says\nexpressions that capture the distinct motion signature of the game/VR character\nrig. The Simon-Says calibrated rigs tend to produce the desired expressions\nwhen exercising animation controls (as expected). Unfortunately, these\nwell-calibrated rigs still lead to undesirable controls when tracking a\nperformance (a well-behaved function can have an arbitrarily ill-conditioned\ninverse), even though they typically produce acceptable geometry\nreconstructions. Thus, we propose a fine-tuning approach that modifies the rig\nused by the tracker in order to promote the output of more semantically\nmeaningful animation controls, facilitating high efficacy retargeting. In order\nto better address real-world scenarios, the fine-tuning relies on implicit\ndifferentiation so that the tracker can be treated as a (potentially\nnon-differentiable) black box."}

Recent filtering methods often suffer\nfrom point clustering or noise retaining issues. In this paper, we propose\nHybrid Point Cloud Filtering ($\\textbf{HybridPF}$) that considers both\nshort-range and long-range filtering trajectories when removing noise. It is\nwell established that short range scores, given by $\\nabla_{x}\\log p(x_t)$, may\nprovide the necessary displacements to move noisy points to the underlying\nclean surface. By contrast, long range velocity flows approximate constant\ndisplacements directed from a high noise variant patch $x_0$ towards the\ncorresponding clean surface $x_1$. Here, noisy patches $x_t$ are viewed as\nintermediate states between the high noise variant and the clean patches. Our\nintuition is that long range information from velocity flow models can guide\nthe short range scores to align more closely with the clean points. In turn,\nscore models generally provide a quicker convergence to the clean surface.\nSpecifically, we devise two parallel modules, the ShortModule and LongModule,\neach consisting of an Encoder-Decoder pair to respectively account for\nshort-range scores and long-range flows.

To rigorously assess the reranker performance in\nterms of noise resilience, relevance disambiguation, and factual consistency,\nwe develop three types of question-context-answer (Q-C-A) pairs, i.e., Noisy\nContexts (NC), Semantically Similar but Logically Irrelevant Contexts (SSLI),\nand Counterfactual Contexts (CC). Through systematic evaluation of 13 widely\nused rerankers on five families of LLMs, we provide detailed insights into\ntheir relative strengths and limitations. To the best of our knowledge,\nSciRerankBench is the first benchmark specifically developed to evaluate\nrerankers within RAG-LLMs, which provides valuable observations and guidance\nfor their future development."}

Due to the loss of\nsemantics of entities, previous RAG systems cannot retrieve question-relevant\nknowledge from KGs by matching questions with the meaningless identifiers of\nanonymous entities. To realize an effective RAG system in this scenario, two\nkey challenges must be addressed: (1) How can anonymous entities be converted\ninto retrievable information.

A single 150KB steering image\nmatches steering vector performance within 1-2% for positive behavioral shifts\nwhile dramatically exceeding it for negative steering--achieving up to 25%\nshifts from baseline compared to steering vectors' modest changes. Unlike\nsystem prompting (3-4% shifts), VISOR provides robust bidirectional control\nwhile maintaining 99.9% performance on 14,000 unrelated MMLU tasks. Beyond\neliminating runtime overhead and model access requirements, VISOR exposes a\ncritical security vulnerability: adversaries can achieve sophisticated\nbehavioral manipulation through visual channels alone, bypassing text-based\ndefenses. Our work fundamentally re-imagines multimodal model control and\nhighlights the urgent need for defenses against visual steering attacks."}

Despite\nadvancements in video comprehension, the substantial computational demands of\nlong video sequences lead current video LLMs (Vid-LLMs) to employ compression\nstrategies at both the inter-frame level (e.g., uniform sampling of video\nframes) and intra-frame level (e.g., condensing all visual tokens of each frame\ninto a limited number). However, this approach often neglects the uneven\ntemporal distribution of critical information across frames, risking the\nomission of keyframes that contain essential temporal and semantic details. To\ntackle these challenges, we propose KFFocus, a method designed to efficiently\ncompress video tokens and emphasize the informative context present within\nvideo frames. We substitute uniform sampling with a refined approach inspired\nby classic video compression principles to identify and capture keyframes based\non their temporal redundancy. By assigning varying condensation ratios to\nframes based on their contextual relevance, KFFocus efficiently reduces token\nredundancy while preserving informative content details. Additionally, we\nintroduce a spatiotemporal modeling module that encodes both the temporal\nrelationships between video frames and the spatial structure within each frame,\nthus providing Vid-LLMs with a nuanced understanding of spatial-temporal\ndynamics.

The dataset includes\nHDR RGB frames under various illuminations, such as white light, environment\nmaps, color gradients and fine-grained OLAT illuminations.

We utilize volumetric morphing in order to\nfit facial rigs to both performers and targets; in addition, a carefully chosen\nset of Simon-Says expressions is used to calibrate each rig to the motion\nsignatures of the relevant performer or target. Although a uniform set of\nSimon-Says expressions can likely be used for all person to person retargeting,\nwe argue that person to game/VR character retargeting benefits from Simon-Says\nexpressions that capture the distinct motion signature of the game/VR character\nrig.

Camera-ready version", "summary": "This paper describes our participation in SemEval 2025 Task 8, focused on\nTabular Question Answering. We developed a zero-shot pipeline that leverages an\nLarge Language Model to generate functional code capable of extracting the\nrelevant information from tabular data based on an input question. Our approach\nconsists of a modular pipeline where the main code generator module is\nsupported by additional components that identify the most relevant columns and\nanalyze their data types to improve extraction accuracy. In the event that the\ngenerated code fails, an iterative refinement process is triggered,\nincorporating the error feedback into a new generation prompt to enhance\nrobustness. Our results show that zero-shot code generation is a valid approach\nfor Tabular QA, achieving rank 33 of 53 in the test phase despite the lack of\ntask-specific fine-tuning."}

As\ntheir commercial potential grows, critical details of the most capable CUA\nsystems remain closed. As these agents will increasingly mediate digital\ninteractions and execute consequential decisions on our behalf, the research\ncommunity needs access to open CUA frameworks to study their capabilities,\nlimitations, and risks. To bridge this gap, we propose OpenCUA, a comprehensive\nopen-source framework for scaling CUA data and foundation models. Our framework\nconsists of: (1) an annotation infrastructure that seamlessly captures human\ncomputer-use demonstrations; (2) AgentNet, the first large-scale computer-use\ntask dataset spanning 3 operating systems and 200+ applications and websites;\n(3) a scalable pipeline that transforms demonstrations into state-action pairs\nwith reflective long Chain-of-Thought reasoning that sustain robust performance\ngains as data scales. Our end-to-end agent models demonstrate strong\nperformance across CUA benchmarks. In particular, OpenCUA-32B achieves an\naverage success rate of 34.8% on OSWorld-Verified, establishing a new\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) among open-source models and surpassing OpenAI CUA\n(GPT-4o). Further analysis confirms that our approach generalizes well across\ndomains and benefits significantly from increased test-time computation. We\nrelease our annotation tool, datasets, code, and models to build open\nfoundations for further CUA research."}

This makes the labeling process both time-consuming and less\nreliable. Specifically, there is a growing demand for approaches that can\neffectively utilize large-scale unlabeled data from online social networks.\nUnlike typical unsupervised learning tasks, where categories are distinct,\nAI-generated faces closely mimic real image distributions and share strong\nsimilarities, causing performance drop in conventional strategies. In this\npaper, we introduce the Dual-Path Guidance Network (DPGNet), to tackle two key\nchallenges: (1) bridging the domain gap between faces from different generation\nmodels, and (2) utilizing unlabeled image samples. The method features two core\nmodules: text-guided cross-domain alignment, which uses learnable prompts to\nunify visual and textual embeddings into a domain-invariant feature space, and\ncurriculum-driven pseudo label generation, which dynamically exploit more\ninformative unlabeled samples. To prevent catastrophic forgetting, we also\nfacilitate bridging between domains via cross-domain knowledge distillation.\nExtensive experiments on \\textbf{11 popular datasets}, show that DPGNet\noutperforms SoTA approaches by \\textbf{6.3\\%}, highlighting its effectiveness\nin leveraging unlabeled data to address the annotation challenges posed by the\nincreasing realism of deepfakes."}

Our work here reveals a critical\nphenomenon, temporal oscillation, where correct answers often emerge in the\nmiddle process, but are overwritten in later denoising steps. To address this\nissue, we introduce two complementary methods that exploit temporal\nconsistency: 1) Temporal Self-Consistency Voting, a training-free, test-time\ndecoding strategy that aggregates predictions across denoising steps to select\nthe most consistent output; and 2) a post-training method termed Temporal\nConsistency Reinforcement, which uses Temporal Semantic Entropy (TSE), a\nmeasure of semantic stability across intermediate predictions, as a reward\nsignal to encourage stable generations. Empirical results across multiple\nbenchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Using the negative\nTSE reward alone, we observe a remarkable average improvement of 24.7% on the\nCountdown dataset over an existing dLLM. Combined with the accuracy reward, we\nachieve absolute gains of 2.0% on GSM8K, 4.3% on MATH500, 6.6% on SVAMP, and\n25.3% on Countdown, respectively. Our findings underscore the untapped\npotential of temporal dynamics in dLLMs and offer two simple yet effective\ntools to harness them."}
