Extending them to\ndensely interacting characters is highly challenging, as it demands precise\nspatial-temporal correspondence between the characters to maintain the\ninteraction, while creating natural transitions towards predefined keyposes. In\nthis research, we present a method for long-horizon interaction in-betweening\nthat enables two characters to engage and respond to one another naturally. To\neffectively represent and synthesize interactions, we propose a novel solution\ncalled Cross-Space In-Betweening, which models the interactions of each\ncharacter across different conditioning representation spaces. We further\nobserve that the significantly increased constraints in interacting characters\nheavily limit the solution space, leading to degraded motion quality and\ndiminished interaction over time. To enable long-horizon synthesis, we present\ntwo solutions to maintain long-term interaction and motion quality, thereby\nkeeping synthesis in the stable region of the solution space.We first sustain\ninteraction quality by identifying periodic interaction patterns through\nadversarial learning. We further maintain the motion quality by learning to\nrefine the drifted latent space and prevent pose error accumulation. We\ndemonstrate that our approach produces realistic, controllable, and\nlong-horizon in-between motions of two characters with dynamic boxing and\ndancing actions across multiple keyposes, supported by extensive quantitative\nevaluations and user studies."}

However,\ndifferences emerge across models: Qwen-Image and SDXL enforce rigid male\ndominance, HiDream-I1-dev shows mixed outcomes, and FLUX.1-dev skews female in\nmost roles. HunyuanImage 2.1 and Stable-Diffusion 3.5 Large also reproduce\ngender stereotypes but with varying degrees of sensitivity to prompt\nformulation.

Beyond documenting disparities, we argue that prompt\nwording plays a critical role in shaping demographic outcomes. The results\nunderscore the need for bias-aware design, balanced defaults, and user guidance\nto prevent the reinforcement of occupational stereotypes in generative AI."}

Specifically, our investigation shows\nthat if an affirmative token for a harmful query appears at an intermediate\nstep, subsequent denoising can be steered toward a harmful response even in\naligned models. As a result, simply injecting such affirmative tokens can\nreadily bypass the safety guardrails. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the\nvulnerability allows existing optimization-based jailbreak attacks to succeed\non DLMs. Building on this analysis, we propose a novel safety alignment method\ntailored to DLMs that trains models to generate safe responses from\ncontaminated intermediate states that contain affirmative tokens. Our\nexperiments indicate that the proposed method significantly mitigates the\nvulnerability with minimal impact on task performance. Furthermore, our method\nimproves robustness against conventional jailbreak attacks. Our work\nunderscores the need for DLM-specific safety research."}

In this paper, we introduce a\nnovel method for Automated Insights and Data Exploration (AIDE), that serves as\na robust foundation for tackling these challenges through the use of Monte\nCarlo Tree Search (MCTS).

Recently, deep learning has been\nwidely applied to cloud detection and has achieved satisfactory results.\nHowever, the lack of distinctive features in thin clouds and the low quality of\ntraining samples limit the cloud detection accuracy of deep learning methods,\nleaving space for further improvements. In this paper, we propose a weakly\nsupervised cloud detection method that combines spectral features and\nmulti-scale scene-level deep network (SpecMCD) to obtain highly accurate\npixel-level cloud masks. The method first utilizes a progressive training\nframework with a multi-scale scene-level dataset to train the multi-scale\nscene-level cloud detection network. Pixel-level cloud probability maps are\nthen obtained by combining the multi-scale probability maps and cloud thickness\nmap based on the characteristics of clouds in dense cloud coverage and large\ncloud-area coverage images. Finally, adaptive thresholds are generated based on\nthe differentiated regions of the scene-level cloud masks at different scales\nand combined with distance-weighted optimization to obtain binary cloud masks.\nTwo datasets, WDCD and GF1MS-WHU, comprising a total of 60 Gaofen-1\nmultispectral (GF1-MS) images, were used to verify the effectiveness of the\nproposed method. Compared to the other weakly supervised cloud detection\nmethods such as WDCD and WSFNet, the F1-score of the proposed SpecMCD method\nshows an improvement of over 7.82%, highlighting the superiority and potential\nof the SpecMCD method for cloud detection under different cloud coverage\nconditions."}

We formalize this bias theoretically, verify it on preference\ndatasets empirically, and show that it plays a central role in mode collapse.\nMotivated by this analysis, we introduce Verbalized Sampling, a simple,\ntraining-free prompting strategy to circumvent mode collapse. VS prompts the\nmodel to verbalize a probability distribution over a set of responses (e.g.,\n``Generate 5 jokes about coffee and their corresponding probabilities'').\nComprehensive experiments show that VS significantly improves performance\nacross creative writing (poems, stories, jokes), dialogue simulation,\nopen-ended QA, and synthetic data generation, without sacrificing factual\naccuracy and safety. For instance, in creative writing, VS increases diversity\nby 1.6-2.1x over direct prompting. We further observe an emergent trend that\nmore capable models benefit more from VS.

Current event-based detection methods are typically\ntrained on predefined categories, limiting their ability to generalize to novel\nobjects, where encountering previously unseen objects is common.\nVision-language models (VLMs) have enabled open-vocabulary object detection in\nRGB images. However, the modality gap between images and event streams makes it\nineffective to directly transfer CLIP to event data, as CLIP was not designed\nfor event streams. To bridge this gap, we propose an event-image knowledge\ndistillation framework that leverages CLIP's semantic understanding to achieve\nopen-vocabulary object detection on event data. Instead of training CLIP\ndirectly on event streams, we use image frames as inputs to a teacher model,\nguiding the event-based student model to learn CLIP's rich visual\nrepresentations. Through spatial attention-based distillation, the student\nnetwork learns meaningful visual features directly from raw event inputs while\ninheriting CLIP's broad visual knowledge.

Our four-stage pipeline processes images\nthrough geometric rectification, zero-shot semantic segmentation, Large\nLanguage Model (LLM) guided spatial reasoning, and energy simulation.\nValidation across 80 buildings in four countries demonstrates ro bust\nperformance with mean area estimation errors of 6.2% &#177; 2.8% compared to\nexpert annotations. The auto mated assessment requires approximately 100\nseconds per building, a substantial gain in efficiency over manual methods.\nSimulated energy yield predictions confirm the method's reliability and\napplicability for regional poten tial studies, urban energy planning, and\nbuilding-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) deployment.

However,\ndifferences emerge across models: Qwen-Image and SDXL enforce rigid male\ndominance, HiDream-I1-dev shows mixed outcomes, and FLUX.1-dev skews female in\nmost roles. HunyuanImage 2.1 and Stable-Diffusion 3.5 Large also reproduce\ngender stereotypes but with varying degrees of sensitivity to prompt\nformulation.

Beyond documenting disparities, we argue that prompt\nwording plays a critical role in shaping demographic outcomes. The results\nunderscore the need for bias-aware design, balanced defaults, and user guidance\nto prevent the reinforcement of occupational stereotypes in generative AI."}

The framework\ncomprises three collaborative agents: (i) Planner, which structures lecture\ncontent into temporally coherent flows and prepares corresponding visual\nassets; (ii) Coder, which converts structured instructions into executable\nPython codes while incorporating scope-guided auto-fix to enhance efficiency;\nand (iii) Critic, which leverages vision-language models (VLM) with visual\nanchor prompts to refine spatial layout and ensure clarity. To support\nsystematic evaluation, we build MMMC, a benchmark of professionally produced,\ndiscipline-specific educational videos. We evaluate MMMC across diverse\ndimensions, including VLM-as-a-Judge aesthetic scores, code efficiency, and\nparticularly, TeachQuiz, a novel end-to-end metric that quantifies how well a\nVLM, after unlearning, can recover knowledge by watching the generated videos.\nOur results demonstrate the potential of Code2Video as a scalable,\ninterpretable, and controllable approach, achieving 40% improvement over direct\ncode generation and producing videos comparable to human-crafted tutorials.

It categorises\nthese alignment errors (e.g., entity omission, duplication, positional\nmisalignment) and surfaces counterexamples that can be used for model debugging\nand refinement. We evaluate MetaLogic across multiple state-of-the-art T2I\nmodels and reveal consistent robustness failures across a range of logical\nconstructs.
