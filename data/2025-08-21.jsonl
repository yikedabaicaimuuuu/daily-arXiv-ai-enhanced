However, tasks that involve active perception, collaborative\nreasoning, and perspective taking (understanding what another agent can see or\nknows) pose persistent challenges for current LLM-based systems. This study\ninvestigates the potential of structured examples derived from transformed\nsolution graphs generated by the Fast Downward planner to improve the\nperformance of LLM-based agents within a ReAct framework. We propose a\nstructured solution-processing pipeline that generates three distinct\ncategories of examples: optimal goal paths (G-type), informative node paths\n(E-type), and step-by-step optimal decision sequences contrasting alternative\nactions (L-type). These solutions are further converted into ``thought-action''\nexamples by prompting an LLM to explicitly articulate the reasoning behind each\ndecision. While L-type examples slightly reduce clarification requests and\noverall action steps, they do not yield consistent improvements. Agents are\nsuccessful in tasks requiring basic attentional filtering but struggle in\nscenarios that required mentalising about occluded spaces or weighing the costs\nof epistemic actions. These findings suggest that structured examples alone are\ninsufficient for robust perspective-taking, underscoring the need for explicit\nbelief tracking, cost modelling, and richer environments to enable socially\ngrounded collaboration in LLM-based agents."}

This paper explores how DLLMs' key\nmechanisms - dynamic masking, iterative generation, bidirectional attention -\nclash with quantization. We identify three core issues: 1) Iterative generation\nand dynamic masking ratios lead to distinct token distributions across decoding\nsteps, which are not adequately captured by existing PTQ calibration methods;\n2) Quantization errors are accumulated and amplified progressively during\niteration in DLLMs, causing quantized models to perform worse as decoding steps\nprogress; 3) Unmasked tokens stabilize while masked remain probabilistic,\nmaking overall feature distribution incompatible with existing PTQ methods. To\naddress these issues, we propose DLLMQuant, a PTQ framework tailored for DLLMs,\nwhich incorporates three novel techniques: 1) Temporal-Mask Adaptive Sampling\n(TMAS), a calibration method that accounts for both time and mask factors, with\nthe capacity to capture distributions across timesteps. 2) Interaction-Aware\nActivation Quantization (IA-AQ), which utilizes bidirectional attention's\ninteraction signals to dynamically allocate quantization resources. 3)\nCertainty-Guided Quantization (CGQ), which integrates mask status and token\nscores as key weighting criteria into error compensation, making weight\nquantization more suitable for DLLMs. Experiments show that DLLMQuant achieves\nsignificant performance gains while enhancing efficiency."}

Therefore, we propose an inter-class\nrelational loss to efficiently update the gradient of small objects while not\nsacrificing the learning efficiency of other objects based on the simple fact\nthat an object has a spatial relationship to another object (e.g., a car plate\nis attached to a car in a similar position).

We address these issues with the Moir\\'e Conditioned Hybrid Adaptive\nTransformer (MoCHA-former), which comprises two key components: Decoupled\nMoir\\'e Adaptive Demoir\\'eing (DMAD) and Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Demoir\\'eing\n(STAD).

STAD\nintroduces a Spatial Fusion Block (SFB) with window attention to capture\nlarge-scale structures, and a Feature Channel Attention (FCA) to model channel\ndependence in RAW frames. To ensure temporal consistency, MoCHA-former performs\nimplicit frame alignment without any explicit alignment module.

During the update\nof multiple objects, the learning of small objects' gradients suffers more\nbecause of insufficient gradient updates. Therefore, we propose an inter-class\nrelational loss to efficiently update the gradient of small objects while not\nsacrificing the learning efficiency of other objects based on the simple fact\nthat an object has a spatial relationship to another object (e.g., a car plate\nis attached to a car in a similar position). When the predicted car plate's\nbounding box is not within its car, a loss punishment is added to guide the\nlearning, which is inversely proportional to the overlapped area of the car's\nand predicted car plate's bounding box.

Therefore, our approach supports all forms of reasoning that\ndepend on the logical structure of the natural language argument, including\narbitrary depths of reasoning, on-the-fly mistake rectification and interactive\ndiscussion with respect to an argument. We show that we can identify and\nextract the logical structure of natural language arguments in three popular\nreasoning datasets with high accuracies, thus supporting explanation generation\nand extending the reasoning capabilities significantly."}

To overcome these, we propose ScenGE, a\nframework that can generate plentiful safety-critical scenarios by reasoning\nnovel adversarial cases and then amplifying them with complex traffic flows.\nGiven a simple prompt of a benign scene, it first performs Meta-Scenario\nGeneration, where a large language model, grounded in structured driving\nknowledge, infers an adversarial agent whose behavior poses a threat that is\nboth plausible and deliberately challenging.

This makes\nthem less effective for practical lighting stylization requirements, especially\nin the challenging task of transferring complex light effects from a reference\nimage to a user-specified target image. To address this problem, we propose\nTransLight, a novel framework that enables high-fidelity and high-freedom\ntransfer of light effects. Extracting the light effect from the reference image\nis the most critical and challenging step in our method. The difficulty lies in\nthe complex geometric structure features embedded in light effects that are\nhighly coupled with content in real-world scenarios. To achieve this, we first\npresent Generative Decoupling, where two fine-tuned diffusion models are used\nto accurately separate image content and light effects, generating a newly\ncurated, million-scale dataset of image-content-light triplets. Then, we employ\nIC-Light as the generative model and train our model with our triplets,\ninjecting the reference lighting image as an additional conditioning signal.\nThe resulting TransLight model enables customized and natural transfer of\ndiverse light effects.

This makes\nthem less effective for practical lighting stylization requirements, especially\nin the challenging task of transferring complex light effects from a reference\nimage to a user-specified target image. To address this problem, we propose\nTransLight, a novel framework that enables high-fidelity and high-freedom\ntransfer of light effects. Extracting the light effect from the reference image\nis the most critical and challenging step in our method. The difficulty lies in\nthe complex geometric structure features embedded in light effects that are\nhighly coupled with content in real-world scenarios. To achieve this, we first\npresent Generative Decoupling, where two fine-tuned diffusion models are used\nto accurately separate image content and light effects, generating a newly\ncurated, million-scale dataset of image-content-light triplets. Then, we employ\nIC-Light as the generative model and train our model with our triplets,\ninjecting the reference lighting image as an additional conditioning signal.\nThe resulting TransLight model enables customized and natural transfer of\ndiverse light effects. Notably, by thoroughly disentangling light effects from\nreference images, our generative decoupling strategy endows TransLight with\nhighly flexible illumination control. Experimental results establish TransLight\nas the first method to successfully transfer light effects across disparate\nimages, delivering more customized illumination control than existing\ntechniques and charting new directions for research in illumination\nharmonization and editing."}

We measure pancreas\nsize and shape using morphological measurements from ages 0 to 90. Our goals\nare to 1) identify reliable clinical imaging modalities for AI-based pancreas\nmeasurement, 2) establish normative morphological aging trends, and 3) detect\npotential deviations in type 2 diabetes.\n  Approach: We analyzed a clinically acquired dataset of 2533 patients imaged\nwith abdominal CT or MRI. We resampled the scans to 3mm isotropic resolution,\nsegmented the pancreas using automated methods, and extracted 13 morphological\npancreas features across the lifespan. First, we assessed CT and MRI\nmeasurements to determine which modalities provide consistent lifespan trends.\nSecond, we characterized distributions of normative morphological patterns\nstratified by age group and sex. Third, we used GAMLSS regression to model\npancreas morphology trends in 1350 patients matched for age, sex, and type 2\ndiabetes status to identify any deviations from normative aging associated with\ntype 2 diabetes.\n  Results: When adjusting for confounders, the aging trends for 10 of 13\nmorphological features were significantly different between patients with type\n2 diabetes and non-diabetic controls (p < 0.05 after multiple comparisons\ncorrections). Additionally, MRI appeared to yield different pancreas\nmeasurements than CT using our AI-based method.\n  Conclusions: We provide lifespan trends demonstrating that the size and shape\nof the pancreas is altered in type 2 diabetes using 675 control patients and\n675 diabetes patients. Moreover, our findings reinforce that the pancreas is\nsmaller in type 2 diabetes.

This encourages the model to learn structural invariances and capture\ndiverse anatomical cues, resulting in more expressive and generalizable\nfeatures.

We introduce a unified representation\nthat jointly models geometry and motion using articulated 3D Gaussians. This\nformulation improves robustness in motion decomposition and supports\narticulated objects with up to 20 parts, significantly outperforming prior\napproaches that often struggle beyond 2--3 parts due to brittle initialization.\nTo systematically assess scalability and generalization, we propose MPArt-90, a\nnew benchmark consisting of 90 articulated objects across 20 categories, each\nwith diverse part counts and motion configurations.

Its\ndifficulty lies on the fact that the story should be both grounded to the image\nsequence but also narrative and coherent. The aim of this work is to balance\nbetween these aspects, by treating Visual Storytelling as a superset of Image\nCaptioning, an approach quite different compared to most of prior relevant\nstudies. This means that we firstly employ a vision-to-language model for\nobtaining captions of the input images, and then, these captions are\ntransformed into coherent narratives using language-to-language methods. Our\nmultifarious evaluation shows that integrating captioning and storytelling\nunder a unified framework, has a positive impact on the quality of the produced\nstories.
