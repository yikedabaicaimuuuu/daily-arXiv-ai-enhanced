We observe that while the Vbench motion smoothness metric\nshows promising alignment with human judgments, it fails in two cases:\nocclusions/disocclusions arising from camera and foreground object movements.\nBuilding on this, we propose a new background consistency metric that leverages\nobject error maps to correct two failure cases in a principled manner.

The system is modular in that one first creates a target\nphonology for the language using an agentic approach that refines its output at\neach step with commentary feedback on its previous attempt. Next, a set of\nsentences is 'translated' from their English original into a morphosyntactic\nmarkup that reflects the word order and morphosyntactic feature specifications\nof the desired target language, with affixes represented as morphosyntactic\nfeature bundles. From this translated corpus, a lexicon is constructed using\nthe phonological model and the set of morphemes (stems and affixes) extracted\nfrom the 'translated' sentences. The system is then instructed to provide an\northography for the language, using an existing script such as Latin or\nCyrillic. Finally, the system writes a brief grammatical handbook of the\nlanguage. The system can also translate further sentences into the target\nlanguage.\n  Our goal is twofold. First, we hope that these tools will be fun to use for\ncreating artificially constructed languages. Second, we are interested in\nexploring what LLMs 'know' about language-not what they know about any\nparticular language or linguistic phenomenon, but how much they know about and\nunderstand language and linguistic concepts. As we shall see, there is a fairly\nwide gulf in capabilities both among different LLMs and among different\nlinguistic specifications, with it being notably easier for systems to deal\nwith more common patterns than rarer ones. An additional avenue that we explore\nis the application of our approach to translating from high-resource into\nlow-resource languages.

We\nargue that on tasks with discrete answer spaces, such as math with numeric\noutputs, Pass@k at large k reflects the increasingly higher chance of success\nin the limit of the number of trials rather than genuine reasoning, and can\ntherefore be misleading. We propose Cover@tau, which measures the fraction of\nproblems that a model can solve for which at least a tau proportion of\ncompletions are correct. Unlike Pass@k, Cover@tau captures reasoning under an\nexplicit reliability threshold: models that rely on random guessing degrade\nrapidly as tau increases. We evaluate several RLVR models using Cover@tau-based\nmetrics and illustrate how the relative rankings of popular algorithms change\ncompared to Pass@1, offering a different perspective on reasoning boundaries."}

In video-language models (Video-LLMs), this phenomenon recently\ndraws the attention of researchers. Specifically, these models fail to provide\nlogically consistent responses to rephrased questions based on their grounding\noutputs. However, the underlying causes of this phenomenon remain\nunderexplored. In this work, we adopt an interpretability-driven approach to\nanalyze, statistically summarize, and intervention the potential factors of the\nphenomenon. We find that one of the primary reasons for the inconsistency in\nresponses lies in the inability of cross-modal attention heads to effectively\ndistinguish video tokens across different timestamps. To address this, we\npropose an attention enhancement method called Temporally Conditioned Attention\nSharpening (TCAS), which constructs an enhancement objective based on attention\ndistinctions to enhance the model's temporal resolution capability, thereby\nimproving its temporal understanding logic consistency. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our method significantly enhances the temporal logic\nconsistency of Video-LLMs. Further interpretability analyses reveal that our\nmethod indeed improves the temporal discriminability of attention heads,\nvalidating our conclusions.

AdaGC adopts a\ngradient calibration (GC) mechanism combined with Mixup and a dual exponential\nmoving average (EMA) module for robust pseudo-label generation. To maximize\nAdaGC's effectiveness, we introduce a simple yet theoretically grounded\nindicator to adaptively trigger GC after an initial warm-up stage based on\ntraining dynamics, thereby guaranteeing the effectiveness of GC in mitigating\noverfitting to label noise. Extensive experiments on two benchmark RS datasets\nunder two distinct label noise types demonstrate that AdaGC achieves\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) performance while maintaining strong robustness across\ndiverse settings."}

Due to the limited availability of\nhigh-quality training samples and the high dimensionality of spectral data, HSI\nclassification models are prone to overfitting and often face challenges in\nbalancing accuracy and computational complexity. Furthermore, most of HSI\nclassification models are monomodal, where it solely relies on spectral-spatial\ndata to learn decision boundaries in the high dimensional embedding space. To\naddress this, we propose a general-purpose Semantic Spectral-Spatial Fusion\nNetwork (S3FN) that uses contextual, class specific textual descriptions to\ncomplement the training of an HSI classification model. Specifically, S3FN\nleverages LLMs to generate comprehensive textual descriptions for each class\nlabel that captures their unique characteristics and spectral behaviors. These\ndescriptions are then embedded into a vector space using a pre-trained text\nencoder such as BERT or RoBERTa to extract meaningful label semantics which in\nturn leads to a better feature-label alignment for improved classification\nperformance. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we evaluate our\nmodel on three diverse HSI benchmark datasets - Hyperspectral Wood,\nHyperspectralBlueberries, and DeepHS-Fruit and report significant performance\nboost.

Project page: https://davidhalladay.github.io/diysink_demo", "summary": "Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have recently emerged as powerful\narchitectures capable of understanding and reasoning over both visual and\ntextual information. These models typically rely on two key components: a\nVision Transformer (ViT) and a Large Language Model (LLM). ViT encodes visual\ncontent into a sequence of image tokens and serves as the perceptual front-end\n-- the eyes of the model. In contrast, the LLM interprets these tokens to\nperform high-level reasoning, generates responses, and functions as the\ncognitive core -- the brain of the model. However, it remains unclear which\nvisual tokens contribute most significantly to understanding and reasoning, and\nhow effectively these signals are propagated from ViT to the LLM. While most\nexisting works have focused on identifying attention sinks, low-semantic tokens\nreceiving disproportionately high attention, within the LLM, we shift the focus\nto the vision encoder by identifying a class of high-norm visual tokens from\nViT, referred to as ViT attention sinks -- a problem that has been rarely\nstudied but is indeed very important for LVLMs. Our findings show that these\nViT sinks encapsulate high-level semantic concepts from images, allowing the\nLLM to perform more effective understanding and reasoning. Despite their\nimportance, these sink tokens are often overlooked in existing LVLM\narchitectures. To explore their contribution, we present both qualitative and\nquantitative analyses of the information embedded in these sink tokens. We also\npropose both training-free and training-based approaches to better leverage how\nthis information is interpreted by the LLM, and to what extent. By explicitly\nutilizing these tokens, we demonstrate substantial improvements across a range\nof LVLMs and visual reasoning tasks, highlighting the untapped potential of ViT\nattention sinks in enhancing visual reasoning."}

Current RL-based methods either rely on dense\nexternal reward signals or extract intrinsic reward signals from LLMs\nthemselves. However, these approaches diverge from the self-evolution\nmechanisms observed in human intelligence, where individuals learn and improve\nthrough mutual discussion and collaboration. In this work, we introduce\nCo-Evolving Multi-Agent Systems (CoMAS), a novel framework that enables agents\nto improve autonomously by learning from inter-agent interactions without\nexternal supervision. CoMAS generates intrinsic rewards from rich discussion\ndynamics, employs an LLM-as-a-judge mechanism to formulate these rewards, and\noptimizes each agent's policy through RL, thereby enabling decentralized and\nscalable co-evolution. Experimental results demonstrate that CoMAS consistently\noutperforms untrained agents and achieves state-of-the-art performance across\nmost evaluation settings. Ablation studies confirm the necessity of\ninteraction-based reward signals and reveal promising scalability as the number\nand diversity of agents increase. These findings establish CoMAS as a novel and\neffective paradigm for self-evolution in LLM-based agents."}

We identify that this limitation stems from a critical\ngap: existing methods attempt to learn spatial reasoning directly without\nestablishing the hierarchical foundations of perception and understanding. To\naddress this challenge, we present a comprehensive methodology for building\nspatial intelligence progressively. We introduce SpatialLadder-26k, a\nmultimodal dataset containing 26,610 samples spanning object localization,\nsingle image, multi-view, and video spatial reasoning tasks, constructed\nthrough a standardized pipeline that ensures systematic coverage across\nmodalities. Building on this dataset, we design a three-stage progressive\ntraining framework that (1) establishes spatial perception through object\nlocalization, (2) develops spatial understanding through multi-dimensional\nspatial tasks, and (3) strengthens complex reasoning via reinforcement learning\nwith verifiable rewards. This approach yields SpatialLadder, a 3B-parameter\nmodel that achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatial reasoning\nbenchmarks, with 23.4% average improvement over the base model, surpassing\nGPT-4o by 20.8% and Gemini-2.0-Flash by 10.1%.

Kontinuous Kontext extends a state-of-the-art image editing model to\naccept an additional input, a scalar edit strength which is then paired with\nthe edit instruction, enabling explicit control over the extent of the edit. To\ninject this scalar information, we train a lightweight projector network that\nmaps the input scalar and the edit instruction to coefficients in the model's\nmodulation space.

We present Memoir, which employs\nimagination as a retrieval mechanism grounded by explicit memory: a world model\nimagines future navigation states as queries to selectively retrieve relevant\nenvironmental observations and behavioral histories. The approach comprises: 1)\na language-conditioned world model that imagines future states serving dual\npurposes: encoding experiences for storage and generating retrieval queries; 2)\nHybrid Viewpoint-Level Memory that anchors both observations and behavioral\npatterns to viewpoints, enabling hybrid retrieval; and 3) an\nexperience-augmented navigation model that integrates retrieved knowledge\nthrough specialized encoders.
