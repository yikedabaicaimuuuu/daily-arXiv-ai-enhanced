In particular,\nthe advancement of video generation foundation models has led to growing demand\nfor controllable video generation methods that can more accurately reflect user\nintent. Most existing foundation models are designed for text-to-video\ngeneration, where text prompts alone are often insufficient to express complex,\nmulti-modal, and fine-grained user requirements. This limitation makes it\nchallenging for users to generate videos with precise control using current\nmodels. To address this issue, recent research has explored the integration of\nadditional non-textual conditions, such as camera motion, depth maps, and human\npose, to extend pretrained video generation models and enable more controllable\nvideo synthesis. These approaches aim to enhance the flexibility and practical\napplicability of AIGC-driven video generation systems. In this survey, we\nprovide a systematic review of controllable video generation, covering both\ntheoretical foundations and recent advances in the field. We begin by\nintroducing the key concepts and commonly used open-source video generation\nmodels. We then focus on control mechanisms in video diffusion models,\nanalyzing how different types of conditions can be incorporated into the\ndenoising process to guide generation.

Its objective\nis to minimize the sum of path costs (SOC), where the path cost of each agent\nis defined as the travel time from its start location to its target location.\nExplicit Estimation Conflict-Based Search (EECBS) is the leading algorithm for\nbounded-suboptimal MAPF, with the SOC of the solution being at most a\nuser-specified factor $w$ away from optimal. EECBS maintains sets of paths and\na lower bound $LB$ on the optimal SOC. Then, it iteratively selects a set of\npaths whose SOC is at most $w \\cdot LB$ and introduces constraints to resolve\ncollisions. For each path in a set, EECBS maintains a lower bound on its\noptimal path that satisfies constraints. By finding an individually\nbounded-suboptimal path with cost at most a threshold of $w$ times its lower\nbound, EECBS guarantees to find a bounded-suboptimal solution. To speed up\nEECBS, previous work uses flex distribution to increase the threshold. Though\nEECBS with flex distribution guarantees to find a bounded-suboptimal solution,\nincreasing the thresholds may push the SOC beyond $w \\cdot LB$, forcing EECBS\nto switch among different sets of paths instead of resolving collisions on a\nparticular set of paths, and thus reducing efficiency.

We propose SIA (Safety\nvia Intent Awareness), a training-free prompt engineering framework that\nproactively detects and mitigates harmful intent in multimodal inputs. SIA\nemploys a three-stage reasoning process: (1) visual abstraction via captioning,\n(2) intent inference through few-shot chain-of-thought prompting, and (3)\nintent-conditioned response refinement. Rather than relying on predefined rules\nor classifiers, SIA dynamically adapts to the implicit intent inferred from the\nimage-text pair. Through extensive experiments on safety-critical benchmarks\nincluding SIUO, MM-SafetyBench, and HoliSafe, we demonstrate that SIA achieves\nsubstantial safety improvements, outperforming prior methods.

These innovations provide a\nscalable and precise solution for automated building footprint extraction from\na single satellite image, paving the way for impactful applications in urban\nplanning, disaster management, and large-scale spatial analysis. Our model,\nDecoupled-PolyGCN, outperforms existing methods by 6% in AP and 10% in AR,\ndemonstrating its ability to deliver accurate and regularized building\nfootprints across diverse and challenging scenarios."}

With the broader trend towards treating subjectivity as an asset and\nnot a problem in NLP, new dimensions of argument quality are studied. Although\nstudies on individual subjective features like personal stories exist, there is\na lack of large-scale analyses of the relation between these features and\nargument strength. To address this gap, we conduct regression analysis to\nquantify the impact of subjective factors $-$ emotions, storytelling, and\nhedging $-$ on two standard datasets annotated for objective argument quality\nand subjective persuasion. As such, our contribution is twofold: at the level\nof contributed resources, as there are no datasets annotated with all studied\ndimensions, this work compares and evaluates automated annotation methods for\neach subjective feature. At the level of novel insights, our regression\nanalysis uncovers different patterns of impact of subjective features on the\ntwo facets of argument strength encoded in the datasets. Our results show that\nstorytelling and hedging have contrasting effects on objective and subjective\nargument quality, while the influence of emotions depends on their rhetoric\nutilization rather than the domain."}

Additionally, by constructing a clinically\naligned cognitive chain, it guides the model to generate interpretable\nreasoning paths.

Recent studies have shown that incorporating large-kernel\nconvolutions and Transformer-inspired architectural designs into CNN can\neffectively expand the receptive field, thereby improving global motion\nperception. Motivated by these insights, we propose a novel CNN-based module\ncalled the Dual-wing Adaptive Dynamic Mixer (DADM), which adaptively captures\nboth global motion patterns and local, fine-grained motion features from\ndynamic inputs. This module dynamically generates selective weights based on\nthe input, enabling efficient multi-scale feature aggregation. To further\nimprove temporal modeling, we introduce the Spatio-Temporal Gating Unit (STGU),\nwhich selectively extracts representative and task-relevant motion features in\nthe temporal domain.

However, this decoupling creates a critical challenge:\npredicting the model capacity of a given MoE configurations (e.g., expert\nactivation ratio and granularity) remains an unresolved problem. To address\nthis gap, we introduce Efficiency Leverage (EL), a metric quantifying the\ncomputational advantage of an MoE model over a dense equivalent. We conduct a\nlarge-scale empirical study, training over 300 models up to 28B parameters, to\nsystematically investigate the relationship between MoE architectural\nconfigurations and EL.

Furthermore, our\napproach surpasses conventional methods by offering enhanced error detection\nand visuali-zation capabilities, providing real-time, actionable guidance to\noperators. This not only improves the accuracy and efficiency of assembly\nmonitoring but also re-duces dependency on expensive hardware solutions, making\nit a more practical choice for modern industrial applications."}

We treat this problem as a pluralistic distributional\nalignment task, comparing the distributions of LLM and human judgments across\ndilemmas. We find that models reproduce human judgments only under high\nconsensus; alignment deteriorates sharply when human disagreement increases. In\nparallel, using a 60-value taxonomy built from 3,783 value expressions\nextracted from rationales, we show that LLMs rely on a narrower set of moral\nvalues than humans. These findings reveal a pluralistic moral gap: a mismatch\nin both the distribution and diversity of values expressed.

This limitation prevents\nthe models from obtaining the abundant information provided by other relevant\ntasks, which can hinder their performance in downstream tasks, particularly in\ncomplex and diverse domains. In order to tackle this issue, we propose MMPT, a\nMulti-modal Multi-task Pre-training framework designed to enhance point cloud\nunderstanding. Specifically, three pre-training tasks are devised: (i)\nToken-level reconstruction (TLR) aims to recover masked point tokens, endowing\nthe model with representative learning abilities. (ii) Point-level\nreconstruction (PLR) is integrated to predict the masked point positions\ndirectly, and the reconstructed point cloud can be considered as a transformed\npoint cloud used in the subsequent task. (iii) Multi-modal contrastive learning\n(MCL) combines feature correspondences within and across modalities, thus\nassembling a rich learning signal from both 3D point cloud and 2D image\nmodalities in a self-supervised manner. Moreover, this framework operates\nwithout requiring any 3D annotations, making it scalable for use with large\ndatasets. The trained encoder can be effectively transferred to various\ndownstream tasks.

We\nintroduce RemixFusion, a novel residual-based mixed representation for scene\nreconstruction and camera pose estimation dedicated to high-quality and\nlarge-scale online RGB-D reconstruction. In particular, we propose a\nresidual-based map representation comprised of an explicit coarse TSDF grid and\nan implicit neural module that produces residuals representing fine-grained\ndetails to be added to the coarse grid. Such mixed representation allows for\ndetail-rich reconstruction with bounded time and memory budget, contrasting\nwith the overly-smoothed results by the purely implicit representations, thus\npaving the way for high-quality camera tracking. Furthermore, we extend the\nresidual-based representation to handle multi-frame joint pose optimization via\nbundle adjustment (BA). In contrast to the existing methods, which optimize\nposes directly, we opt to optimize pose changes.

In our work, we are systematically assessing the\nperformance of 3 state-of-the-art VLMs on a diverse subset of traffic\nsituations sampled from the Waymo Open Dataset to support safety guardrails for\ncapturing such hallucinations in VLM-supported perception systems. We observe\nthat both, proprietary and open VLMs exhibit remarkable image understanding\ncapabilities even paying thorough attention to fine details sometimes difficult\nto spot for us humans. However, they are also still prone to making up elements\nin their descriptions to date requiring hallucination detection strategies such\nas BetterCheck that we propose in our work."}

This framework\nincludes a controlled dataset of face images, a principled filter selection\nprocess that selects a representative range of filters for experimentation, and\na set of experiments to evaluate the filters' impact on recognition. We\ndemonstrate our framework with a case study of filters from the American\napplications Instagram and Snapchat and the Chinese applications Meitu and Pitu\nto uncover cross-cultural differences.

To achieve this high-fidelity\nand interactive video world generation, we introduce a well-designed framework,\nwhich consists of four main components, including camera motion quantization,\nvideo generation architecture, advanced sampler, and model acceleration.

Our method leverages the\ncompact VecSet representation to efficiently generate a coarse object layout in\nthe first stage, reducing token count and accelerating voxel coordinate\nprediction. To refine per-voxel latent features in the second stage, we\nintroduce Part Attention, a geometry-aware localized attention mechanism that\nrestricts attention computation within semantically consistent part regions.\nThis design preserves structural continuity while avoiding unnecessary global\nattention, achieving up to 6.7x speed-up in latent generation. To support this\nmechanism, we construct a scalable part annotation pipeline that converts raw\nmeshes into part-labeled sparse voxels.

In particular,\nthe advancement of video generation foundation models has led to growing demand\nfor controllable video generation methods that can more accurately reflect user\nintent. Most existing foundation models are designed for text-to-video\ngeneration, where text prompts alone are often insufficient to express complex,\nmulti-modal, and fine-grained user requirements. This limitation makes it\nchallenging for users to generate videos with precise control using current\nmodels. To address this issue, recent research has explored the integration of\nadditional non-textual conditions, such as camera motion, depth maps, and human\npose, to extend pretrained video generation models and enable more controllable\nvideo synthesis. These approaches aim to enhance the flexibility and practical\napplicability of AIGC-driven video generation systems. In this survey, we\nprovide a systematic review of controllable video generation, covering both\ntheoretical foundations and recent advances in the field. We begin by\nintroducing the key concepts and commonly used open-source video generation\nmodels. We then focus on control mechanisms in video diffusion models,\nanalyzing how different types of conditions can be incorporated into the\ndenoising process to guide generation. Finally, we categorize existing methods\nbased on the types of control signals they leverage, including single-condition\ngeneration, multi-condition generation, and universal controllable generation.\nFor a complete list of the literature on controllable video generation\nreviewed, please visit our curated repository at\nhttps://github.com/mayuelala/Awesome-Controllable-Video-Generation."}

The\nStreamME synchronously records and reconstructs a head avatar from live video\nstreams without any pre-cached data, enabling seamless integration of the\nreconstructed appearance into downstream applications. This exceptionally fast\ntraining strategy, which we refer to as on-the-fly training, is central to our\napproach.

To further\nensure high efficiency in on-the-fly training, we introduced a simplification\nstrategy based on primary points, which distributes the point clouds more\nsparsely across the facial surface, optimizing points number while maintaining\nrendering quality.

However, they face critical challenges in\nspecialized domains such as ophthalmology, particularly the fragmentation of\nannotation granularity and inconsistencies in clinical reasoning logic, which\nhinder precise cross-modal understanding. This paper introduces FundusExpert,\nan ophthalmology-specific MLLM with integrated positioning-diagnosis reasoning\ncapabilities, along with FundusGen, a dataset constructed through the\nintelligent Fundus-Engine system. Fundus-Engine automates localization and\nleverages MLLM-based semantic expansion to integrate global disease\nclassification, local object detection, and fine-grained feature analysis\nwithin a single fundus image. Additionally, by constructing a clinically\naligned cognitive chain, it guides the model to generate interpretable\nreasoning paths. FundusExpert, fine-tuned with instruction data from FundusGen,\nachieves the best performance in ophthalmic question-answering tasks,\nsurpassing the average accuracy of the 40B MedRegA by 26.6%. It also excels in\nzero-shot report generation tasks, achieving a clinical consistency of 77.0%,\nsignificantly outperforming GPT-4o's 47.6%. Furthermore, we reveal a scaling\nlaw between data quality and model capability ($L \\propto N^{0.068}$),\ndemonstrating that the cognitive alignment annotations in FundusGen enhance\ndata utilization efficiency. By integrating region-level localization with\ndiagnostic reasoning chains, our work develops a scalable, clinically-aligned\nMLLM and explores a pathway toward bridging the visual-language gap in specific\nMLLMs. Our project can be found at https://github.com/MeteorElf/FundusExpert."}
