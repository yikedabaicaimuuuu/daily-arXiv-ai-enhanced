Among other factors, spray boom\ninstability is one of the major contributors to application errors. Spray\nbooms' width of 38m, combined with 30 kph driving speeds, varying terrain, and\nmachine dynamics when maneuvering complex field boundaries, make controls of\nthese booms very complex. However, there is no quantitative knowledge on the\nextent of boom movement to systematically develop a solution that might include\nboom designs and responsive boom control systems. Therefore, this study was\nconducted to develop an automated computer vision system to quantify the boom\nmovement of various agricultural sprayers. A computer vision system was\ndeveloped to track a target on the edge of the sprayer boom in real time. YOLO\nV7, V8, and V11 neural network models were trained to track the boom's\nmovements in field operations to quantify effective displacement in the\nvertical and transverse directions. An inclinometer sensor was mounted on the\nboom to capture boom angles and validate the neural network model output. The\nresults showed that the model could detect the target with more than 90 percent\naccuracy, and distance estimates of the target on the boom were within 0.026 m\nof the inclinometer sensor data. This system can quantify the boom movement on\nthe current sprayer and potentially on any other sprayer with minor\nmodifications. The data can be used to make design improvements to make sprayer\nbooms more stable and achieve greater application accuracy."}

In real-world crowd scenes, the vast majority of spatial regions\n(often over 95%) contain no people, leading to heavily imbalanced count\ndistributions. Ignoring this imbalance can bias models toward overestimating\ndense regions and underperforming in sparse areas. Furthermore, most loss\nfunctions used in density estimation are majorly based on MSE and implicitly\nassume Gaussian distributions, which are ill-suited for modeling discrete,\nnon-negative count data. In this paper, we propose EBC-ZIP, a crowd counting\nframework that models the spatial distribution of counts using a Zero-Inflated\nPoisson (ZIP) regression formulation. Our approach replaces the traditional\nregression loss with the negative log-likelihood of the ZIP distribution,\nenabling better handling of zero-heavy distributions while preserving count\naccuracy. Built upon the recently proposed Enhanced Block Classification (EBC)\nframework, EBC-ZIP inherits EBC's advantages in preserving the discreteness of\ntargets and ensuring training stability, while further improving performance\nthrough a more principled probabilistic loss.

In this paper, we propose a more general probabilistic\nmodel of reading behavior, based on a marked spatio-temporal point process,\nthat captures not only how long fixations last, but also where they land in\nspace and when they take place in time. The saccades are modeled using a Hawkes\nprocess, which captures how each fixation excites the probability of a new\nfixation occurring near it in time and space. The duration time of fixation\nevents is modeled as a function of fixation-specific predictors convolved\nacross time, thus capturing spillover effects. Empirically, our Hawkes process\nmodel exhibits a better fit to human saccades than baselines. With respect to\nfixation durations, we observe that incorporating contextual surprisal as a\npredictor results in only a marginal improvement in the model's predictive\naccuracy. This finding suggests that surprisal theory struggles to explain\nfine-grained eye movements."}

While recent\nsurgical foundation models pretrained on large-scale vision-language data offer\npromising transferability, their zero-shot performance remains constrained by\ndomain shifts, limiting their utility in unseen surgical environments. To\naddress this, we introduce Surgical Phase Anywhere (SPA), a lightweight\nframework for versatile surgical workflow understanding that adapts foundation\nmodels to institutional settings with minimal annotation. SPA leverages\nfew-shot spatial adaptation to align multi-modal embeddings with\ninstitution-specific surgical scenes and phases. It also ensures temporal\nconsistency through diffusion modeling, which encodes task-graph priors derived\nfrom institutional procedure protocols. Finally, SPA employs dynamic test-time\nadaptation, exploiting the mutual agreement between multi-modal phase\nprediction streams to adapt the model to a given test video in a\nself-supervised manner, enhancing the reliability under test-time distribution\nshifts. SPA is a lightweight adaptation framework, allowing hospitals to\nrapidly customize phase recognition models by defining phases in natural\nlanguage text, annotating a few images with the phase labels, and providing a\ntask graph defining phase transitions. The experimental results show that the\nSPA framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in few-shot surgical phase\nrecognition across multiple institutions and procedures, even outperforming\nfull-shot models with 32-shot labeled data.

These value trade-offs are an\nintegral part of human decision-making and language use, however, current tools\nfor interpreting such dynamic and multi-faceted notions of values in LLMs are\nlimited. In cognitive science, so-called \"cognitive models\" provide formal\naccounts of these trade-offs in humans, by modeling the weighting of a\nspeaker's competing utility functions in choosing an action or utterance. In\nthis work, we use a leading cognitive model of polite speech to interpret the\nextent to which LLMs represent human-like trade-offs. We apply this lens to\nsystematically evaluate value trade-offs in two encompassing model settings:\ndegrees of reasoning \"effort\" in frontier black-box models, and RL\npost-training dynamics of open-source models.

However, due to\nthe substantial differences in spatial resolution of the images, the\nperformance of these methods is often unsatisfactory. Moreover, the\nregistration process tends to be time-consuming when dealing with large-sized\nimages in remote sensing. To address these issues, we propose tackling the\nregistration problem from the spectral domain.

However, it remains a\nchallenging task to effectively train the transformer with limited labeled\ndata. In this paper, we propose an adversarial masked image modeling method to\nfully unleash the potential of transformer for semi-supervised medical image\nsegmentation. The key challenge in semi-supervised learning with transformer\nlies in the lack of sufficient supervision signal. To this end, we propose to\nconstruct an auxiliary masked domain from original domain with masked image\nmodeling and train the transformer to predict the entire segmentation mask with\nmasked inputs to increase supervision signal. We leverage the original labels\nfrom labeled data and pseudo-labels from unlabeled data to learn the masked\ndomain. To further benefit the original domain from masked domain, we provide a\ntheoretical analysis of our method from a multi-domain learning perspective and\ndevise a novel adversarial training loss to reduce the domain gap between the\noriginal and masked domain, which boosts semi-supervised learning performance.\nWe also extend adversarial masked image modeling to CNN network. Extensive\nexperiments on three public medical image segmentation datasets demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our method, where our method outperforms existing methods\nsignificantly.

These value trade-offs are an\nintegral part of human decision-making and language use, however, current tools\nfor interpreting such dynamic and multi-faceted notions of values in LLMs are\nlimited. In cognitive science, so-called \"cognitive models\" provide formal\naccounts of these trade-offs in humans, by modeling the weighting of a\nspeaker's competing utility functions in choosing an action or utterance. In\nthis work, we use a leading cognitive model of polite speech to interpret the\nextent to which LLMs represent human-like trade-offs. We apply this lens to\nsystematically evaluate value trade-offs in two encompassing model settings:\ndegrees of reasoning \"effort\" in frontier black-box models, and RL\npost-training dynamics of open-source models. Our results highlight patterns of\nhigher informational utility than social utility in reasoning models, and in\nopen-source models shown to be stronger in mathematical reasoning.

Commercial Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and\nDeepSeek, require substantial resources, while the utilization of these systems\nfor medical purposes raises critical issues regarding patient privacy and\nsafety. Methods We developed a customizable Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n(RAG) framework for medical tasks, which monitors its energy usage and CO2\nemissions.

The RAG model built on llama3.1:8B achieved the highest accuracy\n(58.5%) and was significantly better than other models, including o4-mini and\nDeepSeekV3-R1. The llama3.1-RAG also exhibited the lowest energy consumption\nand CO2 footprint among all models, with a Performance per kWh of 0.52 and a\ntotal CO2 emission of 473g.

To address this problem, we propose a graph-based\npartition-and-summarization (GPaS) framework for dense video captioning within\ntwo stages.

However, a\nkey challenge in current 3D generation methods is the limited explorability,\nwhich cannot render high-quality images during larger maneuvers beyond the\noriginal viewpoint, particularly when attempting to move forward into unseen\nareas. To address this challenge, we propose WonderFree, the first model that\nenables users to interactively generate 3D worlds with the freedom to explore\nfrom arbitrary angles and directions. Specifically, we decouple this challenge\ninto two key subproblems: novel view quality, which addresses visual artifacts\nand floating issues in novel views, and cross-view consistency, which ensures\nspatial consistency across different viewpoints. To enhance rendering quality\nin novel views, we introduce WorldRestorer, a data-driven video restoration\nmodel designed to eliminate floaters and artifacts. In addition, a data\ncollection pipeline is presented to automatically gather training data for\nWorldRestorer, ensuring it can handle scenes with varying styles needed for 3D\nscene generation. Furthermore, to improve cross-view consistency, we propose\nConsistView, a multi-view joint restoration mechanism that simultaneously\nrestores multiple perspectives while maintaining spatiotemporal coherence.\nExperimental results demonstrate that WonderFree not only enhances rendering\nquality across diverse viewpoints but also significantly improves global\ncoherence and consistency.

Cortical surface renderings, on the other hand, provide a more\naccessible and understandable 3D representation of brain anatomy, facilitating\nvisualization and interactive exploration. Motivated by this advantage and the\nwidespread use of surface data for studying neurological disorders, we present\nthe eXplainable Surface Vision Transformer (X-SiT). This is the first\ninherently interpretable neural network that offers human-understandable\npredictions based on interpretable cortical features. As part of X-SiT, we\nintroduce a prototypical surface patch decoder for classifying surface patch\nembeddings, incorporating case-based reasoning with spatially corresponding\ncortical prototypes. The results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in\ndetecting Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia while additionally\nproviding informative prototypes that align with known disease patterns and\nreveal classification errors."}

Although\nthe research community has made impressive progress in addressing the\nchallenges of this complex task, existing methods often generate environments\nthat are only front-facing, lack visual fidelity, exhibit limited scene\nunderstanding, and are typically fine-tuned for either indoor or outdoor\nsettings. In this work, we address these issues and propose DreamAnywhere, a\nmodular system for the fast generation and prototyping of 3D scenes. Our system\nsynthesizes a 360{\\deg} panoramic image from text, decomposes it into\nbackground and objects, constructs a complete 3D representation through hybrid\ninpainting, and lifts object masks to detailed 3D objects that are placed in\nthe virtual environment. DreamAnywhere supports immersive navigation and\nintuitive object-level editing, making it ideal for scene exploration, visual\nmock-ups, and rapid prototyping -- all with minimal manual modeling. These\nfeatures make our system particularly suitable for low-budget movie production,\nenabling quick iteration on scene layout and visual tone without the overhead\nof traditional 3D workflows. Our modular pipeline is highly customizable as it\nallows components to be replaced independently. Compared to current\nstate-of-the-art text and image-based 3D scene generation approaches,\nDreamAnywhere shows significant improvements in coherence in novel view\nsynthesis and achieves competitive image quality, demonstrating its\neffectiveness across diverse and challenging scenarios. A comprehensive user\nstudy demonstrates a clear preference for our method over existing approaches,\nvalidating both its technical robustness and practical usefulness."}

This is largely\ndue to their clinical heterogeneity, low individual prevalence, and the limited\nfamiliarity most clinicians have with rare conditions. Here, we introduce\nDeepRare, the first rare disease diagnosis agentic system powered by a large\nlanguage model (LLM), capable of processing heterogeneous clinical inputs. The\nsystem generates ranked diagnostic hypotheses for rare diseases, each\naccompanied by a transparent chain of reasoning that links intermediate\nanalytic steps to verifiable medical evidence.\n  DeepRare comprises three key components: a central host with a long-term\nmemory module; specialized agent servers responsible for domain-specific\nanalytical tasks integrating over 40 specialized tools and web-scale,\nup-to-date medical knowledge sources, ensuring access to the most current\nclinical information. This modular and scalable design enables complex\ndiagnostic reasoning while maintaining traceability and adaptability. We\nevaluate DeepRare on eight datasets. The system demonstrates exceptional\ndiagnostic performance among 2,919 diseases, achieving 100% accuracy for 1013\ndiseases. In HPO-based evaluations, DeepRare significantly outperforms other 15\nmethods, like traditional bioinformatics diagnostic tools, LLMs, and other\nagentic systems, achieving an average Recall@1 score of 57.18% and surpassing\nthe second-best method (Reasoning LLM) by a substantial margin of 23.79\npercentage points. For multi-modal input scenarios, DeepRare achieves 70.60% at\nRecall@1 compared to Exomiser's 53.20% in 109 cases. Manual verification of\nreasoning chains by clinical experts achieves 95.40% agreements. Furthermore,\nthe DeepRare system has been implemented as a user-friendly web application\nhttp://raredx.cn/doctor."}

In\ncontrast to traditional approaches that rely on text-based prompting or\nexplicit spatial masks, EditP23 enables intuitive edits by conditioning on a\npair of images: an original view and its user-edited counterpart. These image\nprompts are used to guide an edit-aware flow in the latent space of a\npre-trained multi-view diffusion model, allowing the edit to be coherently\npropagated across views.
