To better control the structures of\ngenerated layouts, we disentangle the structural information from the element\nplacements. Our approach is the first data-driven approach that achieves\nconditional structured layout generation and produces realistic layout\nstructures explicitly. We compare our approach with existing data-driven layout\ngeneration approaches by including post-processing for structure extraction.\nExtensive experiments have shown that our approach exceeds these baselines in\nconditional structured layout generation.

In this work, we propose a general hierarchical motion\nmodeling method that learns structured, interpretable motion relationships\ndirectly from data. Our method represents observed motions using graph-based\nhierarchies, explicitly decomposing global absolute motions into\nparent-inherited patterns and local motion residuals. We formulate hierarchy\ninference as a differentiable graph learning problem, where vertices represent\nelemental motions and directed edges capture learned parent-child dependencies\nthrough graph neural networks.

However, this\ntrajectory-to-trajectory formulation often entangles camera motion with scene\ndynamics and complicates both modeling and inference. We introduce SEE4D, a\npose-free, trajectory-to-camera framework that replaces explicit trajectory\nprediction with rendering to a bank of fixed virtual cameras, thereby\nseparating camera control from scene modeling.

The Information-Theoretic Imperative\n(ITI) establishes that any system persisting in uncertain environments must\nminimize epistemic entropy through predictive compression: this is the\nevolutionary \"why\" linking survival pressure to information-processing demands.\nThe Compression Efficiency Principle (CEP) specifies how efficient compression\nmechanically selects for generative, causal models through\nexception-accumulation dynamics, making reality alignment a consequence rather\nthan a contingent achievement. Together, ITI and CEP define a causal chain:\nfrom survival pressure to prediction necessity, compression requirement,\nefficiency optimization, generative structure discovery, and ultimately reality\nalignment. Each link follows from physical, information-theoretic, or\nevolutionary constraints, implying that intelligence is the mechanically\nnecessary outcome of persistence in structured environments. This framework\nyields empirically testable predictions: compression efficiency, measured as\napproach to the rate-distortion frontier, correlates with out-of-distribution\ngeneralization; exception-accumulation rates differentiate causal from\ncorrelational models; hierarchical systems exhibit increasing efficiency across\nabstraction layers; and biological systems demonstrate metabolic costs that\ntrack representational complexity. ITI and CEP thereby provide a unified\naccount of convergence across biological, artificial, and multi-scale systems,\naddressing the epistemic and functional dimensions of intelligence without\ninvoking assumptions about consciousness or subjective experience."}

To address these gaps, we introduce the\nWaymo Open Dataset for End-to-End Driving (WOD-E2E). WOD-E2E contains 4,021\ndriving segments (approximately 12 hours), specifically curated for challenging\nlong-tail scenarios that that are rare in daily life with an occurring\nfrequency of less than 0.03%. Concretely, each segment in WOD-E2E includes the\nhigh-level routing information, ego states, and 360-degree camera views from 8\nsurrounding cameras. To evaluate the E2E driving performance on these long-tail\nsituations, we propose a novel open-loop evaluation metric: Rater Feedback\nScore (RFS). Unlike conventional metrics that measure the distance between\npredicted way points and the logs, RFS measures how closely the predicted\ntrajectory matches rater-annotated trajectory preference labels. We have\nreleased rater preference labels for all WOD-E2E validation set segments, while\nthe held out test set labels have been used for the 2025 WOD-E2E Challenge.\nThrough our work, we aim to foster state of the art research into\ngeneralizable, robust, and safe end-to-end autonomous driving agents capable of\nhandling complex real-world situations."}

This\ntimestep based ordering can be instantiated as either a fixed policy or an\nadaptive policy driven by task signals, thereby supporting a broad spectrum of\nrefinement strategies.

This paper proposes a\npragmatic framework for navigating this diversification by treating personhood\nnot as a metaphysical property to be discovered, but as a flexible bundle of\nobligations (rights and responsibilities) that societies confer upon entities\nfor a variety of reasons, especially to solve concrete governance problems. We\nargue that this traditional bundle can be unbundled, creating bespoke solutions\nfor different contexts. This will allow for the creation of practical tools --\nsuch as facilitating AI contracting by creating a target \"individual\" that can\nbe sanctioned -- without needing to resolve intractable debates about an AI's\nconsciousness or rationality. We explore how individuals fit in to social roles\nand discuss the use of decentralized digital identity technology, examining\nboth \"personhood as a problem\", where design choices can create \"dark patterns\"\nthat exploit human social heuristics, and \"personhood as a solution\", where\nconferring a bundle of obligations is necessary to ensure accountability or\nprevent conflict. By rejecting foundationalist quests for a single, essential\ndefinition of personhood, this paper offers a more pragmatic and flexible way\nto think about integrating AI agents into our society."}

However, many real-world\napplications require a fundamentally different capability -- global RAG --\nwhich involves aggregating and analyzing information across entire document\ncollections to derive corpus-level insights (for example, \"What are the top 10\nmost cited papers in 2023?\"). In this paper, we introduce GlobalQA -- the first\nbenchmark specifically designed to evaluate global RAG capabilities, covering\nfour core task types: counting, extremum queries, sorting, and top-k\nextraction.

Scene-text, i.e., text embedded in natural images such\nas signs, product labels, and storefronts, often carries the most actionable\ninformation; when characters are blurred or hallucinated, optical character\nrecognition(OCR) and subsequent decisions fail even if the rest of the image\nappears sharp.

We propose\nto combine the reconstruction loss with training for dynamic correspondence\nalong with a visibility head, and fine-tuning MASt3R for point tracking using a\nrelatively small amount of synthetic data. Importantly, we only train and\nevaluate on pairs of frames where one contains the query point, effectively\nremoving any temporal context. Using a mix of dynamic and static point\ncorrespondences, we achieve competitive or superior point tracking results on\nfour datasets (e.g. competitive on TAP-Vid-DAVIS 73.8 $\\delta_{avg}$ / 85.8\\%\nocclusion acc. for PointSt3R compared to 75.7 / 88.3\\% for CoTracker2; and\nsignificantly outperform CoTracker3 on EgoPoints 61.3 vs 54.2 and RGB-S 87.0 vs\n82.8). We also present results on 3D point tracking along with several\nablations on training datasets and percentage of dynamic correspondences."}

Unlike prior studies that attribute\nthis text bias to external factors such as data imbalance or instruction\ntuning, we propose that the bias originates from the model's internal\narchitecture. Specifically, we hypothesize that visual key vectors (Visual\nKeys) are out-of-distribution (OOD) relative to the text key space learned\nduring language-only pretraining. Consequently, these visual keys receive\nsystematically lower similarity scores during attention computation, leading to\ntheir under-utilization in the context representation. To validate this\nhypothesis, we extract key vectors from LLaVA and Qwen2.5-VL and analyze their\ndistributional structures using qualitative (t-SNE) and quantitative\n(Jensen-Shannon divergence) methods. The results provide direct evidence that\nvisual and textual keys occupy markedly distinct subspaces within the attention\nspace. The inter-modal divergence is statistically significant, exceeding\nintra-modal variation by several orders of magnitude. These findings reveal\nthat text bias arises from an intrinsic misalignment within the attention key\nspace rather than solely from external data factors."}

Spiking Patches\ngives the means to preserve the unique properties of event cameras and we show\nin our experiments that this comes without sacrificing accuracy. We evaluate\nour tokenizer using a GNN, PCN, and a Transformer on gesture recognition and\nobject detection.

As this failure originates in\nuniform and context agnostic updates, effective control demands explicit token\nordering. We propose Token Timestep Allocation (TTA), which realizes soft and\nsemantic token ordering via per token timestep schedules: critical tokens are\nfrozen early, while uncertain tokens receive continued refinement. This\ntimestep based ordering can be instantiated as either a fixed policy or an\nadaptive policy driven by task signals, thereby supporting a broad spectrum of\nrefinement strategies. Because it operates purely at inference time, it applies\nuniformly across various DLMs and naturally extends to diverse supervision\nsources.

Existing benchmarks\nmostly rely on simplified prompts and focus on low-level metrics, overlooking\nfine-grained alignment with prompts and abstract dimensions such as narrative\ncoherence and thematic expression. To address these gaps, we propose\nLoCoT2V-Bench, a benchmark specifically designed for long video generation\n(LVG) under complex input conditions. Based on various real-world videos,\nLoCoT2V-Bench introduces a suite of realistic and complex prompts incorporating\nelements like scene transitions and event dynamics. Moreover, it constructs a\nmulti-dimensional evaluation framework that includes our newly proposed metrics\nsuch as event-level alignment, fine-grained temporal consistency, content\nclarity, and the Human Expectation Realization Degree (HERD) that focuses on\nmore abstract attributes like narrative flow, emotional response, and character\ndevelopment. Using this framework, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of\nnine representative LVG models, finding that while current methods perform well\non basic visual and temporal aspects, they struggle with inter-event\nconsistency, fine-grained alignment, and high-level thematic adherence, etc.\nOverall, LoCoT2V-Bench provides a comprehensive and reliable platform for\nevaluating long-form complex text-to-video generation and highlights critical\ndirections for future method improvement."}

However, we\nidentify a critical issue during this process: the model excels at generating\nhigh-quality trajectories for simple queries (i.e., head data) but struggles\nwith more complex ones (i.e., tail data). This leads to an imbalanced\noptimization that drives the model to prioritize simple reasoning skills, while\nhindering its ability to tackle more complex reasoning tasks. Over iterations,\nthis imbalance becomes increasingly pronounced--a dynamic we term the \"Matthew\neffect\"--which ultimately hinders further model improvement and leads to\nperformance bottlenecks. To counteract this challenge, we introduce four\nefficient strategies from two perspectives: distribution-reshaping and\ntrajectory-resampling, to achieve head-tail re-balancing during the\nexploration-and-learning self-improvement process.

We show that such\ncollections of relation decoders can be highly compressed by simple order-3\ntensor networks without significant loss in decoding accuracy. To explain this\nsurprising redundancy, we develop a cross-evaluation protocol, in which we\napply each linear decoder operator to the subjects of every other relation. Our\nresults reveal that these linear maps do not encode distinct relations, but\nextract recurring, coarse-grained semantic properties (e.g., country of capital\ncity and country of food are both in the country-of-X property). This\nproperty-centric structure clarifies both the operators' compressibility and\nhighlights why they generalize only to new relations that are semantically\nclose.
