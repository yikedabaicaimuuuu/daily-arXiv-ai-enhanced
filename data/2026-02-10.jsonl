While there has been work in automatic approximate convex decompositions of meshes using convex hulls, they are not practical for applications with tight performance budgets such as games due to slower collision detection and inability to manually modify the output while maintaining convexity as compared to manually placed primitives. Rather than convex decomposition with convex hulls, we devise an approach for bottom-up decomposition of an input mesh into convex primitives specifically for rigid body simulation inspired by quadric mesh simplification. This approach fits primitives to complex, real-world meshes that provide plausible simulation performance and are guaranteed to enclose the input surface. We test convex primitive decomposition on over 60 models from Sketchfab, showing the algorithm's effectiveness. On this dataset, convex primitive decomposition has lower one-way mean and median Hausdorff and Chamfer distance from the collider to the input compared to V-HACD and CoACD, with less than one-third of the complexity as measured by total bytes for each collider. On top of that, rigid-body simulation performance measured by wall-clock time is consistently improved across 24 tested models."}

Using a Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) parameterization of the Koopman operator, our method learns the temporal evolution of deformable dynamics and predicts future states through efficient matrix evaluations instead of sequential time integration. This yields log-linear scaling in the number of time steps and allows large portions of the trajectory to be skipped while retaining accuracy. The resulting temporal efficiency is especially advantageous for optimization tasks such as control and initial-state estimation, where the objective often depends largely on the final configuration.\n  To broaden the scope of Koopman-based reduced-order models in graphics, we introduce a discretization-agnostic extension that learns shared dynamic behavior across multiple shapes and mesh resolutions. Prior DMD-based approaches have been restricted to a single shape and discretization, which limits their usefulness for tasks involving geometry variation. Our formulation generalizes across both shape and discretization, which enables fast shape optimization that was previously impractical for DMD models. This expanded capability highlights the potential of Koopman operator learning as a practical tool for efficient deformable simulation and design."}

Packing algorithms seek to arrange a set of charts within a fixed-size atlas with as little downscaling as possible. Many packing applications such as content creation tools, dynamic atlas generation for video games, and texture space shading require on-the-fly interactive atlas packing. Unfortunately, while many methods have been developed for generating tight high-quality packings, they are designed for offline settings and have running times two or more orders of magnitude greater than what is required for interactive performance. While real-time GPU packing methods exist, they significantly downscale packed charts compared to offline methods. We introduce a GPU packing method that targets interactive speeds, provides packing quality approaching that of offline methods, and supports flexible user control over the tradeoff between performance and quality. We observe that current real-time packing methods leave large gaps between charts and often produce asymmetric, or poorly balanced, packings. These artifacts dramatically degrade packing quality. Our Tight And Balanced method eliminates these artifacts while retaining Interactive performance. TABI generates tight packings by compacting empty space between irregularly shaped charts both horizontally and vertically, using two approximations of chart shape that support efficient parallel processing. We balance packing outputs by automatically adjusting atlas row widths and orientations to accommodate varying chart heights. We show that our method significantly reduces chart downscaling compared to existing interactive methods while remaining orders of magnitude faster than offline alternatives."}

Standard MPM practices suffer from a performance bottleneck where expensive implicit solves are proportional to particle-per-cell (PPC) counts due to the the choices of particle-based quadrature and wide-stencil kernels. In contrast, MPM Lite treats particles primarily as carriers of kinematic state and material history. By conceptualizing the background Cartesian grid as a voxel hexahedral mesh, we resample particle states onto fixed-location quadrature points using efficient, compact linear kernels. This architectural shift allows force assembly and the entire time-integration process to proceed without accessing particles, making the solver complexity no longer relate to particles. At the core of our method is a novel stress transfer and stretch reconstruction strategy. To avoid non-physical averaging of deformation gradients, we resample the extensive Kirchhoff stress and derive a rotation-free deformation reference solution, which naturally supports an optimization-based incremental potential formulation. Consequently, MPM Lite can be implemented as modular resampling units coupled with an FEM-style integration module, enabling the direct use of off-the-shelf nonlinear solvers, preconditioners, and unambiguous boundary conditions. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that MPM Lite preserves the robustness and versatility of traditional MPM across diverse materials while delivering significant speedups in implicit settings and improving explicit settings at the same time.

In this paper, we present LLM-FSM, a benchmark that evaluates how well large language models (LLMs) can recover finite-state machine (FSM) behavior from natural-language specifications and translate it into correct register transfer-level (RTL) implementations. Unlike prior specification-to-RTL benchmarks that rely on manually constructed examples, LLM-FSM is built through a fully automated pipeline. LLM-FSM first constructs FSM with configurable state counts and constrained transition structures. It then prompts LLMs to express each FSM in a structured YAML format with an application context, and to further convert that YAML into a natural-language (NL) specification. From the same YAML, our pipeline synthesizes the reference RTL and testbench in a correct-by-construction manner. All 1,000 problems are verified using LLM-based and SAT-solver-based checks, with human review on a subset. Our experiments show that even the strongest LLMs exhibit sharply declining accuracy as FSM complexity increases. We further demonstrate that training-time scaling via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) generalizes effectively to out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks, while increasing test-time compute improves reasoning reliability. Finally, LLM-FSM remains extensible by allowing its FSM complexity to scale with future model capabilities."}

We investigate a fundamental question, does visual rendering truly decouple a model from tokenization constraints? Focusing on four Indonesian low-resource local languages that have their own non-Latin scripts (i.e., Javanese, Balinese, Sundanese, and Lampungnese), we evaluate the impact of script-tokenizer alignment within the DualGPT architecture. Our results show that, despite visual rendering, reintegrating a text tokenizer into the architecture reintroduces the same issue that pixel-based language modeling aims to resolve, which is the tokenizer misalignment problem. Despite having lower OOV and fertility rates, we show that the Llama 2 tokenizer performs significantly worse than a custom tokenizer, with improvements of up to 30.15 chrF++. Our findings serve as a warning for future multimodal variants, as text tokenizers remain a significant barrier to equitable models."}

Dey"], "title": "Scalable spatial point process models for forensic footwear analysis", "comment": null, "summary": "Shoe print evidence recovered from crime scenes plays a key role in forensic investigations. By examining shoe prints, investigators can determine details of the footwear worn by suspects. However, establishing that a suspect's shoes match the make and model of a crime scene print may not be sufficient. Typically, thousands of shoes of the same size, make, and model are manufactured, any of which could be responsible for the print. Accordingly, a popular approach used by investigators is to examine the print for signs of ``accidentals,'' i.e., cuts, scrapes, and other features that accumulate on shoe soles after purchase due to wear. While some patterns of accidentals are common on certain types of shoes, others are highly distinctive, potentially distinguishing the suspect's shoe from all others. Quantifying the rarity of a pattern is thus essential to accurately measuring the strength of forensic evidence. In this study, we address this task by developing a hierarchical Bayesian model. Our improvement over existing methods primarily stems from two advancements. First, we frame our approach in terms of a latent Gaussian model, thus enabling inference to be efficiently scaled to large collections of annotated shoe prints via integrated nested Laplace approximations. Second, we incorporate spatially varying coefficients to model the relationship between shoes' tread patterns and accidental locations. We demonstrate these improvements through superior performance on held-out data, which enhances accuracy and reliability in forensic shoe print analysis."}

In graphics, numerical integrators like implicit Euler and BDF2 are preferred due to their stability at large time steps, but they tend to dissipate energy uncontrollably. In contrast, symplectic methods like implicit midpoint can conserve energy but are not unconditionally stable and fail on moderately stiff problems. To address these limitations, we propose a general class of numerical integrators for Hamiltonian problems which are symplectic on linear problems, yet have superior stability on nonlinear problems. With this, we derive a novel energy-controllable time integrator, A-search, a simple modification of implicit Euler that can follow user-specified energy targets, enabling flexible control over energy dissipation or conservation while maintaining stability and physical fidelity. Our method integrates seamlessly with barrier-type energies and allows for inversion-free and penetration-free guarantees, making it well-suited for handling large deformations and complex collisions. Extensive evaluations over a wide range of material parameters and scenes demonstrate that A-search has biases to keep energy in low frequency motion rather than dissipation, and A-search outperforms traditional methods such as BDF2 at similar total running times by maintaining energy and leading to more visually desirable simulations."}

Yet conventional supervised learning typically provides only class-level labels, allowing models to achieve high accuracy through shortcut correlations rather than the intended evidence. Human priors can help constrain such behavior, but aligning models to these priors remains challenging because learned representations often diverge from human perception. To address this challenge, we propose an attribution-based human prior alignment method. We encode human priors as input regions that the model is expected to rely on (e.g., bounding boxes), and leverage a highly faithful subset-selection-based attribution approach to expose the model's decision evidence during training. When the attribution region deviates substantially from the prior regions, we penalize reliance on off-prior evidence, encouraging the model to shift its attribution toward the intended regions. This is achieved through a training objective that imposes attribution constraints induced by the human prior. We validate our method on both image classification and click decision tasks in MLLM-based GUI agent models. Across conventional classification and autoregressive generation settings, human prior alignment consistently improves task accuracy while also enhancing the model's decision reasonability."}

While super-resolution is widely used in production, it uniformly sacrifices spatial detail and cannot exploit variations in noise, reconstruction difficulty, and perceptual importance across the image. Adaptive sampling offers a compelling alternative, but existing end-to-end approaches rely on approximations that break down in sparse regimes.\n  We introduce an end-to-end adaptive sampling and denoising pipeline explicitly designed for the sub-1-spp regime. Our method uses a stochastic formulation of sample placement that enables gradient estimation despite discrete sampling decisions, allowing stable training of a neural sampler at low sampling budgets. To better align optimization with human perception, we propose a tonemapping-aware training pipeline that integrates differentiable filmic operators and a state-of-the-art perceptual loss, preventing oversampling of regions with low visual impact.\n  In addition, we introduce a gather-based pyramidal denoising filter and a learnable generalization of albedo demodulation tailored to sparse sampling. Our results show consistent improvements over uniform sparse sampling, with notably better reconstruction of perceptually critical details such as specular highlights and shadow boundaries, and demonstrate that adaptive sampling remains effective even at minimal budgets."}

Meanwhile, despite the rapid advancement of Search Agents, their practical deployment is constrained by a fundamental limitation, termed as 1) Latency Challenge: the serial execution of multi-round reasoning, tool calling, and tool response waiting under the ReAct agent paradigm induces severe end-to-end latency. Intuitively, dLLMs can leverage their distinctive strengths to optimize the operational efficiency of agents under the ReAct agent paradigm. Practically, existing dLLM backbones face the 2) Agent Ability Challenge. That is, existing dLLMs exhibit remarkably weak reasoning and tool-calling capabilities, preventing these advantages from being effectively realized in practice. In this paper, we propose DLLM-Searcher, an optimization framework for dLLM-based Search Agents. To solve the Agent Ability Challenge, we design a two-stage post-training pipeline encompassing Agentic Supervised Fine-Tuning (Agentic SFT) and Agentic Variance-Reduced Preference Optimization Agentic VRPO, which enhances the backbone dLLM's information seeking and reasoning capabilities. To mitigate the Latency Challenge, we leverage the flexible generation mechanism of dLLMs and propose a novel agent paradigm termed Parallel-Reasoning and Acting P-ReAct. P-ReAct guides the model to prioritize decoding tool_call instructions, thereby allowing the model to keep thinking while waiting for the tool's return.

By modeling essential human-like behaviors as a suite of tools, ILA-agent enables LLMs to incrementally explore, apply, and verify language knowledge through structured interactions with the official documentation and execution environment.

Project page: https://lhyfst.github.io/balancehead/", "summary": "Conditioning is crucial for stable training of full-head 3D GANs. Without any conditioning signal, the model suffers from severe mode collapse, making it impractical to training. However, a series of previous full-head 3D GANs conventionally choose the view angle as the conditioning input, which leads to a bias in the learned 3D full-head space along the conditional view direction. This is evident in the significant differences in generation quality and diversity between the conditional view and non-conditional views of the generated 3D heads, resulting in global incoherence across different head regions. In this work, we propose to use view-invariant semantic feature as the conditioning input, thereby decoupling the generative capability of 3D heads from the viewing direction. To construct a view-invariant semantic condition for each training image, we create a novel synthesized head image dataset. We leverage FLUX.1 Kontext to extend existing high-quality frontal face datasets to a wide range of view angles. The image clip feature extracted from the frontal view is then used as a shared semantic condition across all views in the extended images, ensuring semantic alignment while eliminating directional bias. This also allows supervision from different views of the same subject to be consolidated under a shared semantic condition, which accelerates training and enhances the global coherence of the generated 3D heads. Moreover, as GANs often experience slower improvements in diversity once the generator learns a few modes that successfully fool the discriminator, our semantic conditioning encourages the generator to follow the true semantic distribution, thereby promoting continuous learning and diverse generation. Extensive experiments on full-head synthesis and single-view GAN inversion demonstrate that our method achieves significantly higher fidelity, diversity, and generalizability."}

Generative models for materials could help, but are currently limited by the lack of high-quality training data. While recent video generative models effortlessly produce realistic material appearances, this knowledge remains entangled with geometry and lighting. We present VideoNeuMat, a two-stage pipeline that extracts reusable neural material assets from video diffusion models. First, we finetune a large video model (Wan 2.1 14B) to generate material sample videos under controlled camera and lighting trajectories, effectively creating a \"virtual gonioreflectometer\" that preserves the model's material realism while learning a structured measurement pattern. Second, we reconstruct compact neural materials from these videos through a Large Reconstruction Model (LRM) finetuned from a smaller Wan 1.3B video backbone. From 17 generated video frames, our LRM performs single-pass inference to predict neural material parameters that generalize to novel viewing and lighting conditions. The resulting materials exhibit realism and diversity far exceeding the limited synthetic training data, demonstrating that material knowledge can be successfully transferred from internet-scale video models into standalone, reusable neural 3D assets."}

While multimodal foundation models excel at passive perception, their capacity for active, self-directed exploration remains understudied. We propose Theory of Space, defined as an agent's ability to actively acquire information through self-directed, active exploration and to construct, revise, and exploit a spatial belief from sequential, partial observations. We evaluate this through a benchmark where the goal is curiosity-driven exploration to build an accurate cognitive map. A key innovation is spatial belief probing, which prompts models to reveal their internal spatial representations at each step. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art models reveals several critical bottlenecks. First, we identify an Active-Passive Gap, where performance drops significantly when agents must autonomously gather information. Second, we find high inefficiency, as models explore unsystematically compared to program-based proxies. Through belief probing, we diagnose that while perception is an initial bottleneck, global beliefs suffer from instability that causes spatial knowledge to degrade over time. Finally, using a false belief paradigm, we uncover Belief Inertia, where agents fail to update obsolete priors with new evidence. This issue is present in text-based agents but is particularly severe in vision-based models. Our findings suggest that current foundation models struggle to maintain coherent, revisable spatial beliefs during active exploration."}

Project page: https://maxmilite.github.io/rec-from-ultrafast-blur/", "summary": "We consider the problem of 3D shape recovery from ultra-fast motion-blurred images. While 3D reconstruction from static images has been extensively studied, recovering geometry from extreme motion-blurred images remains challenging. Such scenarios frequently occur in both natural and industrial settings, such as fast-moving objects in sports (e.g., balls) or rotating machinery, where rapid motion distorts object appearance and makes traditional 3D reconstruction techniques like Multi-View Stereo (MVS) ineffective.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel inverse rendering approach for shape recovery from ultra-fast motion-blurred images. While conventional rendering techniques typically synthesize blur by averaging across multiple frames, we identify a major computational bottleneck in the repeated computation of barycentric weights. To address this, we propose a fast barycentric coordinate solver, which significantly reduces computational overhead and achieves a speedup of up to 4.57x, enabling efficient and photorealistic simulation of high-speed motion. Crucially, our method is fully differentiable, allowing gradients to propagate from rendered images to the underlying 3D shape, thereby facilitating shape recovery through inverse rendering.\n  We validate our approach on two representative motion types: rapid translation and rotation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method enables efficient and realistic modeling of ultra-fast moving objects in the forward simulation. Moreover, it successfully recovers 3D shapes from 2D imagery of objects undergoing extreme translational and rotational motion, advancing the boundaries of vision-based 3D reconstruction.

Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate a similar flexibility in adopting different personas and behaviors. Existing approaches, however, typically adapt such behavior through external knowledge such as prompting, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), or fine-tuning. We ask: do LLMs really need external context or parameters to adapt to different behaviors, or do they already have such knowledge embedded in their parameters? In this work, we show that LLMs already contain persona-specialized subnetworks in their parameter space. Using small calibration datasets, we identify distinct activation signatures associated with different personas. Guided by these statistics, we develop a masking strategy that isolates lightweight persona subnetworks. Building on the findings, we further discuss: how can we discover opposing subnetwork from the model that lead to binary-opposing personas, such as introvert-extrovert? To further enhance separation in binary opposition scenarios, we introduce a contrastive pruning strategy that identifies parameters responsible for the statistical divergence between opposing personas. Our method is entirely training-free and relies solely on the language model's existing parameter space. Across diverse evaluation settings, the resulting subnetworks exhibit significantly stronger persona alignment than baselines that require external knowledge while being more efficient. Our findings suggest that diverse human-like behaviors are not merely induced in LLMs, but are already embedded in their parameter space, pointing toward a new perspective on controllable and interpretable personalization in large language models."}

The first stage is an Iterative Gaussian Instance Tracing (IGIT) at the temporal segment level. It progressively refines Gaussian-to-instance probabilities through iterative tracing, and extracts corresponding Gaussian point clouds that better handle occlusions and preserve completeness of object structures compared to existing one-shot threshold-based methods. The second stage is a frame-wise Gaussian Rendering Range Control (RCC) via suppressing highly uncertain Gaussians near object boundaries while retaining their core contributions for more accurate boundaries. Furthermore, a temporal segmentation merging strategy is proposed for IGIT to balance identity consistency and dynamic awareness. Longer segments enforce stronger multi-frame constraints for stable identities, while shorter segments allow identity changes to be captured promptly. Experiments on HyperNeRF and Neu3D demonstrate that our method produces accurate object Gaussian point clouds with clearer boundaries and higher efficiency compared to SOTA methods."}

Away from the frontier, however, proprietary techniques and shared algorithmic progress substantially reduce the compute required to reach fixed capability thresholds. Some companies can systematically produce smaller models more efficiently. Strikingly, we also find substantial variation of model efficiency within companies; a firm can train two models with more than 40x compute efficiency difference.

In recent years, inverse rendering methods have been inspired by view synthesis approaches like neural radiance fields and Gaussian splatting, which are capable of efficiently decomposing a scene into its geometry and radiance. They then further estimate the material and lighting that lead to the observed scene radiance. However, the latter step is highly ambiguous and prior works suffer from inaccurate color and baked shadows in their albedo estimation albeit their regularization. To this end, we propose RotLight, a simple capturing setup, to address the ambiguity. Compared to a usual capture, RotLight only requires the object to be rotated several times during the process. We show that as few as two rotations is effective in reducing artifacts. To further improve 2DGS-based inverse rendering, we additionally introduce a proxy mesh that not only allows accurate incident light tracing, but also enables a residual constraint and improves global illumination handling.

Existing safety frameworks largely treat alignment as a static optimization problem (e.g., tuning models to desired behavior) while overlooking the dynamic, adversarial incentives that shape how data are collected, how models are evaluated, and how they are ultimately deployed. We propose a new perspective on AI safety grounded in Stackelberg Security Games (SSGs): a class of game-theoretic models designed for adversarial resource allocation under uncertainty. By viewing AI oversight as a strategic interaction between defenders (auditors, evaluators, and deployers) and attackers (malicious actors, misaligned contributors, or worst-case failure modes), SSGs provide a unifying framework for reasoning about incentive design, limited oversight capacity, and adversarial uncertainty across the AI lifecycle. We illustrate how this framework can inform (1) training-time auditing against data/feedback poisoning, (2) pre-deployment evaluation under constrained reviewer resources, and (3) robust multi-model deployment in adversarial environments. This synthesis bridges algorithmic alignment and institutional oversight design, highlighting how game-theoretic deterrence can make AI oversight proactive, risk-aware, and resilient to manipulation."}

In this work, we present a comprehensive investigation on how to enable directional multi-talker speech understanding capabilities for LLMs, specifically in smart glasses usecase. We propose two novel approaches to integrate directivity into LLMs: (1) a cascaded system that leverages a source separation front-end module, and (2) an end-to-end system that utilizes serialized output training. All of the approaches utilize a multi-microphone array embedded in smart glasses to optimize directivity interpretation and processing in a streaming manner. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed methods in endowing LLMs with directional speech understanding capabilities, achieving strong performance in both speech recognition and speech translation tasks."}

Existing bird strike prevention strategies primarily rely on avian radar systems that detect and track birds in real time. A major limitation of these systems is their inability to identify bird species, an essential factor, as different species exhibit distinct flight behaviors, and altitudinal preference. To address this challenge, we propose an image-based bird classification framework using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), designed to work with camera systems for autonomous visual detection. The CNN is designed to identify bird species and provide critical input to species-specific predictive models for accurate flight path prediction. In addition to species identification, we implemented dedicated CNN classifiers to estimate flock formation type and flock size. These characteristics provide valuable supplementary information for aviation safety. Specifically, flock type and size offer insights into collective flight behavior, and trajectory dispersion . Flock size directly relates to the potential impact severity, as the overall damage risk increases with the combined kinetic energy of multiple birds."}

Using a two-parameter logistic Item Response Theory model, we jointly estimate latent task difficulty and model capability from model performance data across multiple benchmarks. We demonstrate that latent task difficulty varies linearly with the logarithm of human completion time, allowing human task completion time to be inferred for new benchmarks from model performance alone. Leveraging this alignment, we forecast frontier model capabilities in terms of human task length and independently reproduce METR's exponential scaling results, with the 50% solvable task horizon doubling approximately every 6 months."}

However, existing hallucination standards and evaluation metrics focus primarily on factual correctness, treating all errors as equally severe. This obscures clinically relevant failure modes, particularly when models generate unsupported but actionable medical language. We propose a risk-sensitive evaluation framework that quantifies hallucinations through the presence of risk-bearing language, including treatment directives, contraindications, urgency cues, and mentions of high-risk medications. Rather than assessing clinical correctness, our approach evaluates the potential impact of hallucinated content if acted upon. We further combine risk scoring with a relevance measure to identify high-risk, low-grounding failures. We apply this framework to three instruction-tuned language models using controlled patient-facing prompts designed as safety stress tests. Our results show that models with similar surface-level behavior exhibit substantially different risk profiles and that standard evaluation metrics fail to capture these distinctions. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating risk sensitivity into hallucination evaluation and suggest that evaluation validity is critically dependent on task and prompt design."}

Here, we propose a mechanistic insight by analyzing the representational geometry of open-weight VLMs (Qwen, InternVL, Gemma), comparing methodologies to distill \"concept vectors\" - latent directions encoding visual concepts. We validate our concept vectors via steering interventions that reliably manipulate model behavior in both simplified and naturalistic vision tasks (e.g., forcing the model to perceive a red flower as blue). We observe that the geometric overlap between these vectors strongly correlates with specific error patterns, offering a grounded quantitative framework to understand how internal representations shape model behavior and drive visual failures."}

First, high-fidelity, executable training environments are scarce: environments synthesized from real-world repositories are not diverse and scalable, while trajectories synthesized by LLMs suffer from hallucinations. Second, standard instruction tuning uses expert trajectories that rarely exhibit simple mistakes common to smaller models. This creates a distributional mismatch, leaving student models ill-equipped to recover from their own runtime failures. To bridge these gaps, we introduce TermiGen, an end-to-end pipeline for synthesizing verifiable environments and resilient expert trajectories. Termi-Gen first generates functionally valid tasks and Docker containers via an iterative multi-agent refinement loop. Subsequently, we employ a Generator-Critic protocol that actively injects errors during trajectory collection, synthesizing data rich in error-correction cycles. Fine-tuned on this TermiGen-generated dataset, our TermiGen-Qwen2.5-Coder-32B achieves a 31.3% pass rate on TerminalBench.

Users often employ follow-up questions to refine their intent, expecting LLMs to adapt dynamically. However, recent research reveals that LLMs suffer a substantial performance drop in multi-turn settings compared to single-turn interactions with fully specified instructions, a phenomenon termed ``Lost in Conversation'' (LiC). While this prior work attributes LiC to model unreliability, we argue that the root cause lies in an intent alignment gap rather than intrinsic capability deficits. In this paper, we first demonstrate that LiC is not a failure of model capability but rather a breakdown in interaction between users and LLMs. We theoretically show that scaling model size or improving training alone cannot resolve this gap, as it arises from structural ambiguity in conversational context rather than representational limitations. To address this, we propose to decouple intent understanding from task execution through a Mediator-Assistant architecture. By utilizing an experience-driven Mediator to explicate user inputs into explicit, well-structured instructions based on historical interaction patterns, our approach effectively bridges the gap between vague user intent and model interpretation. Experimental results demonstrate that this method significantly mitigates performance degradation in multi-turn conversations across diverse LLMs."}

Prior approaches to bridge this gap are largely limited by oversimplified isotropic assumptions, hindering their application in large-scale scenarios. In this paper, we address these limitations by precisely characterizing the geometric shape of the modality gap and leveraging it for efficient model scaling. First, we propose the Fixed-frame Modality Gap Theory, which decomposes the modality gap within a frozen reference frame into stable biases and anisotropic residuals. Guided by this precise modeling, we introduce ReAlign, a training-free modality alignment strategy. Utilizing statistics from massive unpaired data, ReAlign aligns text representation into the image representation distribution via a three-step process comprising Anchor, Trace, and Centroid Alignment, thereby explicitly rectifying geometric misalignment. Building on ReAlign, we propose ReVision, a scalable training paradigm for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). ReVision integrates ReAlign into the pretraining stage, enabling the model to learn the distribution of visual representations from unpaired text before visual instruction tuning, without the need for large-scale, high-quality image-text pairs. Our framework demonstrates that statistically aligned unpaired data can effectively substitute for expensive image-text pairs, offering a robust path for the efficient scaling of MLLMs."}

To address this limitation, we propose STEER2ADAPT, a lightweight framework that adapts LLMs by composing steering vectors rather than learning new ones from scratch. In many domains (e.g., reasoning or safety), tasks share a small set of underlying concept dimensions. STEER2ADAPT captures these dimensions as a reusable, low-dimensional semantic prior subspace, and adapts to new tasks by dynamically discovering a linear combination of basis vectors from only a handful of examples. Experiments across 9 tasks and 3 models in both reasoning and safety domains demonstrate the effectiveness of STEER2ADAPT, achieving an average improvement of 8.2%. Extensive analyses further show that STEER2ADAPT is a data-efficient, stable, and transparent inference-time adaptation method for LLMs."}

In this work, we introduce the Vietnamese Healthcare Regulations-Multihop Reasoning Dataset (ViHERMES), a benchmark designed for multihop QA over Vietnamese healthcare regulatory documents. ViHERMES consists of high-quality question-answer pairs that require reasoning across multiple regulations and capture diverse dependency patterns, including amendment tracing, cross-document comparison, and procedural synthesis. To construct the dataset, we propose a controlled multihop QA generation pipeline based on semantic clustering and graph-inspired data mining, followed by large language model-based generation with structured evidence and reasoning annotations.

We propose Fair Context Learning (FCL), an episodic TTA framework that avoids entropy minimization by explicitly addressing shared-evidence bias. Motivated by our additive evidence decomposition assumption, FCL decouples adaptation into (i) augmentation-based exploration to identify plausible class candidates, and (ii) fairness-driven calibration that adapts text contexts to equalize sensitivity to common visual evidence. This fairness constraint mitigates partial feature obsession and enables effective calibration of text embeddings without relying on entropy reduction. Through extensive evaluation, we empirically validate our theoretical motivation and show that FCL achieves competitive adaptation performance relative to state-of-the-art TTA methods across diverse domain-shift and fine-grained benchmarks."}

The framework operates on multi-view smartphone photographs,embeds diagnostic heuristics from dental experts, and guides a general-purpose VLM to perform tooth-level evaluation without dental-specific fine-tuning of the VLM. By utilizing the VLM's existing visual-linguistic capabilities, OMNI-Dent aims to support diagnostic assessment in settings where curated clinical imaging is unavailable. Designed as an early-stage assistive tool, OMNI-Dent helps users identify potential abnormalities and determine when professional evaluation may be needed, offering a practical option for individuals with limited access to in-person care."}

While recent efforts have successfully enhanced these agents by scaling depth through increasing the number of sequential thinking and tool calls, the potential of scaling width via parallel tool calling remains largely unexplored. In this work, we propose the Wide and Deep research agent, a framework designed to investigate the behavior and performance of agents when scaling not only depth but also width via parallel tool calling. Unlike existing approaches that rely on complex multi-agent orchestration to parallelize workloads, our method leverages intrinsic parallel tool calling to facilitate effective coordination within a single reasoning step. We demonstrate that scaling width significantly improves performance on deep research benchmarks while reducing the number of turns required to obtain correct answers. Furthermore, we analyze the factors driving these improvements through case studies and explore various tool call schedulers to optimize parallel tool calling strategy. Our findings suggest that optimizing the trade-off between width and depth is a critical pathway toward high-efficiency deep research agents.

We term this failure mode Axis Collapse, marked by (1) disjoint feature spaces causing catastrophic forgetting, and (2) unreliable inference from misrouted experts. To resolve this, we propose AlignX, a two-stage framework. Stage 1 uses prompt-injected fine-tuning to extract axis-specific task features, mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Stage 2 deploys a MoCaE module that calibrates expert routing using fractal and natural geometry, improving inference reliability. AlignX achieves significant gains on Alpaca (Helpfulness), BeaverTails (Harmlessness), and TruthfulQA (Honesty), with +171.5% win rate, +110.1% in truthfulness-informativeness, and 4.3% fewer safety violations. It also reduces latency and memory usage by over 35% compared to prior MoEs. Results across four LLMs validate its generalizability."}

We present a novel unsupervised semi-parametric framework COMBOOD for OOD detection with respect to image recognition. Our framework combines signals from two distance metrics, nearest-neighbor and Mahalanobis, to derive a confidence score for an inference point to be out-of-distribution. The former provides a non-parametric approach to OOD detection. The latter provides a parametric, simple, yet effective method for detecting OOD data points, especially, in the far OOD scenario, where the inference point is far apart from the training data set in the embedding space. However, its performance is not satisfactory in the near OOD scenarios that arise in practical situations. Our COMBOOD framework combines the two signals in a semi-parametric setting to provide a confidence score that is accurate both for the near-OOD and far-OOD scenarios. We show experimental results with the COMBOOD framework for different types of feature extraction strategies. We demonstrate experimentally that COMBOOD outperforms state-of-the-art OOD detection methods on the OpenOOD (both version 1 and most recent version 1.5) benchmark datasets (for both far-OOD and near-OOD) as well as on the documents dataset in terms of accuracy. On a majority of the benchmark datasets, the improvements in accuracy resulting from the COMBOOD framework are statistically significant. COMBOOD scales linearly with the size of the embedding space, making it ideal for many real-life applications."}

We ask a concrete question: when the generation paradigm is changed but the agent framework and supervision are held fixed, do diffusion backbones induce systematically different planning and tool-use behaviors, and do these differences translate into end-to-end efficiency gains? We study this in a controlled setting by instantiating DLLM and AR backbones within the same agent workflow (DeepDiver) and performing matched agent-oriented fine-tuning on the same trajectory data, yielding diffusion-backed DLLM Agents and directly comparable AR agents. Across benchmarks and case studies, we find that, at comparable accuracy, DLLM Agents are on average over 30% faster end to end than AR agents, with some cases exceeding 8x speedup. Conditioned on correct task completion, DLLM Agents also require fewer interaction rounds and tool invocations, consistent with higher planner hit rates that converge earlier to a correct action path with less backtracking. We further identify two practical considerations for deploying diffusion backbones in tool-using agents. First, naive DLLM policies are more prone to structured tool-call failures, necessitating stronger tool-call-specific training to emit valid schemas and arguments. Second, for multi-turn inputs interleaving context and action spans, diffusion-style span corruption requires aligned attention masking to avoid spurious context-action information flow; without such alignment, performance degrades. Finally, we analyze attention dynamics across workflow stages and observe paradigm-specific coordination patterns, suggesting stronger global planning signals in diffusion-backed agents."}

The Owen formula for hierarchical Shapley values has been widely used to interpret machine learning (ML) models and their learned representations. However, existing hierarchical Shapley approaches do not exploit the multiscale structure of image data, leading to slow convergence and weak alignment with the actual morphological features. Moreover, no prior Shapley method has leveraged data-aware hierarchies for Computer Vision tasks, leaving a gap in model interpretability of structured visual data. To address this, this paper introduces ShapBPT, a novel data-aware XCV method based on the hierarchical Shapley formula. ShapBPT assigns Shapley coefficients to a multiscale hierarchical structure tailored for images, the Binary Partition Tree (BPT). By using this data-aware hierarchical partitioning, ShapBPT ensures that feature attributions align with intrinsic image morphology, effectively prioritizing relevant regions while reducing computational overhead. This advancement connects hierarchical Shapley methods with image data, providing a more efficient and semantically meaningful approach to visual interpretability. Experimental results confirm ShapBPT's effectiveness, demonstrating superior alignment with image structures and improved efficiency over existing XCV methods, and a 20-subject user study confirming that ShapBPT explanations are preferred by humans."}

Human personality, for instance, shapes how individuals navigate social interactions, including strategic choices and behaviors in emotionally charged interactions. This raises the question: Can LLMs, when prompted with personality traits, reproduce personality-driven differences in human conflict behavior? To explore this, we introduce an evaluation framework that enables direct comparison of human-human and LLM-LLM behaviors in dispute resolution dialogues with respect to Big Five Inventory (BFI) personality traits. This framework provides a set of interpretable metrics related to strategic behavior and conflict outcomes. We additionally contribute a novel dataset creation methodology for LLM dispute resolution dialogues with matched scenarios and personality traits with respect to human conversations.

This lack of distributional diversity severely restricts the exploration efficiency required for subsequent RL. While recent studies have attempted to improve SFT by replacing the CE loss, aiming to preserve diversity or refine the update policy, they fail to adequately balance diversity and accuracy, thereby yielding suboptimal performance after RL. To address the mode collapse problem, we propose SED-SFT, which adaptively encourages diversity based on the token exploration space. This framework introduces a selective entropy regularization term with a selective masking mechanism into the optimization objective. Extensive experiments across eight mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that SED-SFT significantly enhances generation diversity with a negligible computational overhead increase compared with CE loss, yielding average improvements of 2.06 and 1.20 points in subsequent RL performance over standard CE-based baselines on Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct, respectively.

ECHWR utilizes a temporary auxiliary branch that aligns sensor signals with semantic text embeddings during the training phase. This alignment is maintained through a dual contrastive objective: an in-batch contrastive loss for general modality alignment and a novel error-based contrastive loss that distinguishes between correct signals and synthetic hard negatives. The auxiliary branch is discarded after training, which allows the deployed model to keep its original, efficient architecture. Evaluations on the OnHW-Words500 dataset show that ECHWR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, reducing character error rates by up to 7.4% on the writer-independent split and 10.4% on the writer-dependent split.

This signal converges with independent content, ownership, and network indicators across 91,792 posts and 405,707 comments from 22,020 agents. No viral phenomenon originated from a clearly autonomous agent; three of six traced to accounts with irregular temporal signatures characteristic of human intervention, one showed mixed patterns, and two had insufficient posting history for classification. A 44-hour platform shutdown provided a natural experiment: human-influenced agents returned first (87.7% of early reconnectors), confirming that the token reset differentially affected autonomous versus human-operated agents. We further document industrial-scale bot farming (four accounts producing 32% of all comments with 12-second coordination gaps) and rapid decay of human influence through reply chains (half-life: 0.65 conversation depths).

While modern video world models achieve strong performance on intuitive physics benchmarks, it remains unclear which of these representational regimes they implement internally. Here, we present the first interpretability study to directly examine physical representations inside large-scale video encoders. Using layerwise probing, subspace geometry, patch-level decoding, and targeted attention ablations, we characterize where physical information becomes accessible and how it is organized within encoder-based video transformers.\n  Across architectures, we identify a sharp intermediate-depth transition -- which we call the Physics Emergence Zone -- at which physical variables become accessible. Physics-related representations peak shortly after this transition and degrade toward the output layers. Decomposing motion into explicit variables, we find that scalar quantities such as speed and acceleration are available from early layers onwards, whereas motion direction becomes accessible only at the Physics Emergence Zone. Notably, we find that direction is encoded through a high-dimensional population structure with circular geometry, requiring coordinated multi-feature intervention to control. These findings suggest that modern video models do not use factorized representations of physical variables like a classical physics engine.

We design seven interventions (benign, neutral, and adversarial) and apply them to multiple open-weight RLLMs across Math, Science, and Logic tasks. Our results show that RLLMs are generally robust, reliably recovering from diverse perturbations, with robustness improving with model size and degrading when interventions occur early. However, robustness is not style-invariant: paraphrasing suppresses doubt-like expressions and reduces performance, while other interventions trigger doubt and support recovery. Recovery also carries a cost: neutral and adversarial noise can inflate CoT length by more than 200%, whereas paraphrasing shortens traces but harms accuracy. These findings provide new evidence on how RLLMs maintain reasoning integrity, identify doubt as a central recovery mechanism, and highlight trade-offs between robustness and efficiency that future training methods should address."}

We propose a framework that decomposes complex simplifications into manageable steps through dynamic path planning, semantic-aware exemplar selection, and chain-of-thought generation with conversation history for coherent reasoning. Evaluation on five languages across two benchmarks shows our approach improves simplification effectiveness while reducing computational steps by 22-42%. Human evaluation confirms the fundamental trade-off between simplification effectiveness and meaning preservation. Notably, even human annotators struggle to agree on semantic preservation judgments, highlighting the inherent complexity of this task. Our work shows that while step-by-step simplification improves control, preserving semantic fidelity during extensive simplification remains an open challenge."}

This research presents Neural Sentinel, a novel unified approach that leverages Vision Language Models (VLMs) to perform license plate recognition, state classification, and vehicle attribute extraction through a single forward pass. Our primary contribution lies in demonstrating that a fine-tuned PaliGemma 3B model, adapted via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), can simultaneously answer multiple visual questions about vehicle images, achieving 92.3% plate recognition accuracy, which is a 14.1% improvement over EasyOCR and 9.9% improvement over PaddleOCR baselines. We introduce a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) continual learning framework that incorporates user corrections while preventing catastrophic forgetting through experience replay, maintaining a 70:30 ratio of original training data to correction samples. The system achieves a mean inference latency of 152ms with an Expected Calibration Error (ECE) of 0.048, indicating well calibrated confidence estimates. Additionally, the VLM first architecture enables zero-shot generalization to auxiliary tasks including vehicle color detection (89%), seatbelt detection (82%), and occupancy counting (78%) without task specific training. Through extensive experimentation on real world toll plaza imagery, we demonstrate that unified vision language approaches represent a paradigm shift in ALPR systems, offering superior accuracy, reduced architectural complexity, and emergent multi-task capabilities that traditional pipeline approaches cannot achieve."}

However, many verification and synthesis problems for POMDPs are undecidable or intractable. Most prominently, the seminal result of Madani et al. (2003) states that there is no algorithm that, given a POMDP and a set of target states, can compute the maximal probability of reaching the target states, or even approximate it up to a non-trivial constant. This is in stark contrast to fully observable Markov decision processes (MDPs), where the reachability value can be computed in polynomial time.\n  In this work, we introduce posterior-deterministic POMDPs, a novel class of POMDPs. Our main technical contribution is to show that for posterior-deterministic POMDPs, the maximal probability of reaching a given set of states can be approximated up to arbitrary precision.\n  A POMDP is posterior-deterministic if the next state can be uniquely determined by the current state, the action taken, and the observation received. While the actual state is generally uncertain in POMDPs, the posterior-deterministic property tells us that once the true state is known it remains known forever. This simple and natural definition includes all MDPs and captures classical non-trivial examples such as the Tiger POMDP (Kaelbling et al. 1998), making it one of the largest known classes of POMDPs for which the reachability value can be approximated."}

When the length is unknown, as in realistic completion and infilling, naively comparing confidence across mask lengths becomes systematically biased, leading to under-generation or redundant continuations. In this paper, we show that this failure arises from an intrinsic lengthinduced bias in generation confidence estimates, leaving existing DLLMs without a robust way to determine generation length and making variablelength inference unreliable. To address this issue, we propose LR-DLLM, a length-regularized inference framework for DLLMs that treats generation length as an explicit variable and achieves reliable length determination at inference time. It decouples semantic compatibility from lengthinduced uncertainty through an explicit length regularization that corrects biased confidence estimates. Based on this, LR-DLLM enables dynamic expansion or contraction of the generation span without modifying the underlying DLLM or its training procedure. Experiments show that LRDLLM achieves 51.3% Pass@1 on HumanEvalInfilling under fully unknown lengths (+13.4% vs. DreamOn) and 51.5% average Pass@1 on four-language McEval (+14.3% vs. DreamOn)."}

We introduce and evaluate markerless approaches that replace expensive hardware and physical markers with low-cost visible and infrared light cameras incorporating stereo and depth sensing combined with algorithmic modeling of the facial geometry. Validation with $50$ human subjects yielded a median tracking discrepancy of only $2.32$ mm and $2.01°$ for the best markerless algorithms compared to a conventional marker-based system, which indicates sufficient accuracy for transcranial magnetic stimulation and a substantial improvement over prior markerless results.

Yet, the challenge is no longer access to information but connecting it in meaningful, domain-spanning ways. In materials science, where innovation demands integrating concepts from molecular chemistry to mechanical performance, this is especially acute. Neither humans nor single-agent LLMs can fully contend with this torrent of information, with the latter often prone to hallucinations. To address this bottleneck, we introduce a multi-agent framework guided by large-scale knowledge graphs to find sustainable substitutes for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)-chemicals currently under intense regulatory scrutiny. Agents in the framework specialize in problem decomposition, evidence retrieval, design parameter extraction, and graph traversal, uncovering latent connections across distinct knowledge pockets to support hypothesis generation. Ablation studies show that the full multi-agent pipeline outperforms single-shot prompting, underscoring the value of distributed specialization and relational reasoning. We demonstrate that by tailoring graph traversal strategies, the system alternates between exploitative searches focusing on domain-critical outcomes and exploratory searches surfacing emergent cross-connections. Illustrated through the exemplar of biomedical tubing, the framework generates sustainable PFAS-free alternatives that balance tribological performance, thermal stability, chemical resistance, and biocompatibility. This work establishes a framework combining knowledge graphs with multi-agent reasoning to expand the materials design space, showcasing several initial design candidates to demonstrate the approach."}

In this work, we conduct an in-depth investigation of this asymmetry throughout training evolution and show that, even on the same task, improving generation does not lead to corresponding improvements in self-verification. Interestingly, we find that the reverse direction of this asymmetry behaves differently: learning to self-verify can effectively improve generation performance, achieving accuracy comparable to standard generation training while yielding more efficient and effective reasoning traces. Building on this observation, we further explore integrating self-verification into generation training by formulating a multi-task reinforcement learning framework, where generation and self-verification are optimized as two independent but complementary objectives. Extensive experiments across benchmarks and models demonstrate performance gains over generation-only training in both generation and verification capabilities."}

Generative reward models offer stronger semantic understanding and reasoning, but they are costly at inference time and difficult to align directly with human preferences. To this end, we propose Joint Reward Modeling (JRM), which jointly optimizes preference learning and language modeling on a shared vision-language backbone. This approach internalizes the semantic and reasoning capabilities of generative models into efficient discriminative representations, enabling fast and accurate evaluation. JRM achieves state-of-the-art results on MMRB2 and EditReward-Bench, and significantly improves stability and performance in downstream online reinforcement learning.

Despite recent progress, unlearning in text-to-image diffusion models remains challenging due to high computational costs and the difficulty of balancing effective forgetting with retention of unrelated concepts. We introduce FADE (Fast Adapter for Data Erasure), a two-stage unlearning method for image generation that combines parameter localization with self-distillation. FADE first identifies parameters most responsible for the forget set using gradient-based saliency and constrains updates through sparse LoRA adapters, ensuring lightweight, localized modifications. In a second stage, FADE applies a self-distillation objective that overwrites the forgotten concept with a user-defined surrogate while preserving behavior on retained data. The resulting adapters are memory-efficient, reversible, and can be merged or removed at runtime, enabling flexible deployment in production systems. We evaluated FADE on the UnlearnCanvas benchmark and conducted ablation studies on Imagenette, Labeled Faces in the Wild, AtharvaTaras Dog Breeds Dataset, and SUN Attributes datasets, demonstrating State-of-the-Art unlearning performance with fine-grained control over the forgetting-retention trade-off.

Although several AI-based approaches have been proposed to address isolated subtasks of MSP, a unified methodology for solving the entire MSP task has yet to be established. We propose MSP-LLM, a unified LLM-based framework that formulates MSP as a structured process composed of two constituent subproblems: precursor prediction (PP) and synthesis operation prediction (SOP). Our approach introduces a discrete material class as an intermediate decision variable that organizes both tasks into a chemically consistent decision chain. For OP, we further incorporate hierarchical precursor types as synthesis-relevant inductive biases and employ an explicit conditioning strategy that preserves precursor-related information in the autoregressive decoding state. Extensive experiments show that MSP-LLM consistently outperforms existing methods on both PP and SOP, as well as on the complete MSP task, demonstrating an effective and scalable framework for MSP that can accelerate real-world materials discovery."}

Prior works on LLM-based tutoring typically learn a single tutor policy and do not capture the diversity of tutoring styles. In real-world tutor-student interactions, pedagogical intent is realized through adaptive instructional strategies, with tutors varying the level of scaffolding, instructional directiveness, feedback, and affective support in response to learners' needs. These differences can all impact dialogue dynamics and student engagement. In this paper, we explore how tutor personas embedded in human tutor-student dialogues can be used to guide LLM behavior without relying on explicitly prompted instructions. We modify Bidirectional Preference Optimization (BiPO) to learn a steering vector, an activation-space direction that steers model responses towards certain tutor personas. We find that this steering vector captures tutor-specific variation across dialogue contexts, improving semantic alignment with ground-truth tutor utterances and increasing preference-based evaluations, while largely preserving lexical similarity. Analysis of the learned directional coefficients further reveals interpretable structure across tutors, corresponding to consistent differences in tutoring behavior. These results demonstrate that activation steering offers an effective and interpretable way for controlling tutor-specific variation in LLMs using signals derived directly from human dialogue data."}

The method formulates contamination assessment as a regression task at the railcar level and leverages sequential data through multi-instance learning (MIL) and multi-task learning (MTL).

Yet it remains unclear whether they reliably reason across all requirements by tracking, verifying, and maintaining multiple conditions in these questions. We study this capability under multi-constraint problems, where valid answers must satisfy several constraints simultaneously. We find that illusory completion frequently occurs, wherein agents believe tasks are complete despite unresolved or violated constraints, leading to underverified answers. To diagnose this behavior, we introduce the Epistemic Ledger, an evaluation framework that tracks evidential support and agents' beliefs for each constraint throughout multi-turn reasoning. Our analysis reveals four recurring failure patterns: bare assertions, overlooked refutations, stagnation, and premature exit. Motivated by these findings, we examine whether explicit constraint-state tracking during execution mitigates these failures via LiveLedger, an inference-time tracker. This simple intervention consistently improves performance, substantially reducing underverified answers (by up to 26.5%) and improving overall accuracy (by up to 11.6%) on multi-constraint problems."}

While recent studies have looked into these biases, few have analyzed them at a more granular level in relation to a well-defined overlap metric. In this work we provide an LLM judge bias analysis as a function of overlap with human-written responses in the domain of summarization. We test 9 recent LLMs with parameter counts ranging from 1 billion to 12 billion, including variants of Gemma 3 and LLaMA 3. We find that LLM judges increasingly prefer summaries generated by other LLMs over those written by humans as the similarities (as measured by ROUGE and BLEU) between the judged summaries decrease, and this pattern extends to all but one model tested, and exists regardless of the models' own position biases. Additionally, we find that models struggle to judge even summaries with limited overlaps, suggesting that LLM-as-a-judge in the summary domain should rely on techniques beyond a simple comparison."}

Here, we present an efficient deep learning based end-to-end approach for the estimation of continuum displacement and material compressibility directly from the image series. Based on two deep neural networks for image registration and material compressibility estimation, this framework outperforms conventional approaches in terms of efficiency and accuracy. In particular, our experimental results show that the deep learning model trained on a set of reference data can accurately determine the material compressibility even in the presence of substantial local deviations of the mapping predicted by image registration from the reference displacement field. Our findings suggest that the remarkable accuracy of the deep learning end-to-end model originates from its ability to assess higher-order cognitive features, such as the vorticity of the vector field, rather than conventional local features of the image displacement."}

Current personalized multimodal models are predominantly static-concepts are fixed at initialization and cannot evolve during interactions. We propose M2A, an agentic dual-layer hybrid memory system that maintains personalized multimodal information through online updates. The system employs two collaborative agents: ChatAgent manages user interactions and autonomously decides when to query or update memory, while MemoryManager breaks down memory requests from ChatAgent into detailed operations on the dual-layer memory bank, which couples a RawMessageStore (immutable conversation log) with a SemanticMemoryStore (high-level observations), providing memories at different granularities. In addition, we develop a reusable data synthesis pipeline that injects concept-grounded sessions from Yo'LLaVA and MC-LLaVA into LoCoMo long conversations while preserving temporal coherence. Experiments show that M2A significantly outperforms baselines, demonstrating that transforming personalization from one-shot configuration to a co-evolving memory mechanism provides a viable path for high-quality individualized responses in long-term multimodal interactions.

Existing approaches rely on heuristic methods such as selecting recent interactions or prompting summarization models to compress user profiles. However, these methods treat context as a monolithic whole and fail to consider how LLMs internally process and prioritize different profile components. We investigate whether LLMs' attention patterns can effectively identify important personalization signals for intelligent context compression. Through preliminary studies on representative personalization tasks, we discover that (a) LLMs' attention patterns naturally reveal important signals, and (b) fine-tuning enhances LLMs' ability to distinguish between relevant and irrelevant information. Based on these insights, we propose Attn-GS, an attention-guided context compression framework that leverages attention feedback from a marking model to mark important personalization sentences, then guides a compression model to generate task-relevant, high-quality compressed user contexts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Attn-GS significantly outperforms various baselines across different tasks, token limits, and settings, achieving performance close to using full context while reducing token usage by 50 times."}

For structural fidelity easily affected in ReFL, the model is directly optimized on synthetic pairs at early diffusion steps, which also facilitates structure preservation for real-world inputs under smaller distribution gap in structure levels. For perceptual enhancement, quality-guided rewards are applied at later sampling steps to both synthetic and real LR images. To mitigate reward hacking, the rewards for synthetic results are formulated in a relative advantage space bounded by their clean counterparts, while real-world optimization is regularized via a semantic alignment constraint. Furthermore, to balance structural and perceptual learning, we adopt a dynamic fidelity-perception weighting strategy that emphasizes structure preservation at early stages and progressively shifts focus toward perceptual optimization at later diffusion steps.

To address this, we introduce SleepMaMi , a Sleep Foundation Model engineered to master both hour-long sleep architectures and fine-grained signal morphologies. Our framework utilizes a hierarchical dual-encoder design: a Macro-Encoder to model full-night temporal dependencies and a Micro-Encoder to capture short-term characteristics from biosignals. Macro-Encoder is trained via Demographic-Guided Contrastive Learning, which aligns overnight sleep patterns with objective subject metadata, such as age, sex and BMI to refine global representations. Micro-Encoder is optimized via a hybrid Masked Autoencoder (MAE) and multi-modal contrastive objective.

Our results reveal a conceptual subspace emerging in middle to late layers, whose representational structure persists across contexts. Using causal mediation analyses, we demonstrate that this subspace is not merely an epiphenomenon but is functionally central to model predictions, establishing its causal role in inference. We further identify a layer-wise progression where attention heads in early-to-middle layers integrate contextual cues to construct and refine the subspace, which is subsequently leveraged by later layers to generate predictions. Together, these findings provide evidence that LLMs dynamically construct and use structured, latent representations in context for inference, offering insights into the computational processes underlying flexible adaptation."}

In this paper, we present a new inference-time computing technique for on-device embodied AI, namely \\emph{MosaicThinker}, which enhances the on-device small VLM's spatial reasoning capabilities on difficult cross-frame reasoning tasks.

However, a more practical scenario involves identifying and reasoning over relevant tables from large-scale collections to answer user queries. To address this gap, we propose TabRAG, a framework that enables MLLMs to answer queries over large collections of table images. Our approach first retrieves candidate tables using jointly trained visual-text foundation models, then leverages MLLMs to perform fine-grained reranking of these candidates, and finally employs MLLMs to reason over the selected tables for answer generation.

Our experiments span across seven models, three benchmarks, and two thinking instantiations, and we evaluate them through both a quantitative response taxonomy analysis and qualitative failure propagation case studies. Contrary to expectations, we find that mandatory thinking often backfires on agents in user-engaged settings, causing anomalous performance degradation across various LLMs. Our key finding reveals that thinking makes agents more ``introverted'' by shortening responses and reducing information disclosure to users, which weakens agent-user information exchange and leads to downstream task failures. Furthermore, we demonstrate that explicitly prompting for information disclosure reliably improves performance across diverse model families, suggesting that proactive transparency is a vital lever for agent optimization.

Some examples are advances in artificial intelligence that make machines more and more humanlike, and the introduction of decentralized technologies (e.g. blockchains), which creates new forms of (decentralized) trust. These new developments have the potential to improve the provision of products and services, as well as to contribute to individual and collective well-being. However, their adoption depends largely on trust. In order to build trustworthy systems, along with defining laws, regulations and proper governance models for new forms of trust, it is necessary to properly conceptualize trust, so that it can be understood both by humans and machines. This paper is the culmination of a long-term research program of providing a solid ontological foundation on trust, by creating reference conceptual models to support information modeling, automated reasoning, information integration and semantic interoperability tasks. To address this, a Reference Ontology of Trust (ONTrust) was developed, grounded on the Unified Foundational Ontology and specified in OntoUML, which has been applied in several initiatives, to demonstrate, for example, how it can be used for conceptual modeling and enterprise architecture design, for language evaluation and (re)design, for trust management, for requirements engineering, and for trustworthy artificial intelligence (AI) in the context of affective Human-AI teaming. ONTrust formally characterizes the concept of trust and its different types, describes the different factors that can influence trust, as well as explains how risk emerges from trust relations. To illustrate the working of ONTrust, the ontology is applied to model two case studies extracted from the literature."}

Layer-wise pruning, a commonly employed strategy to mitigate inference costs, can partially address this challenge. However, existing approaches generally depend on static heuristic rules and fail to account for the interdependencies among layers, thereby limiting the effectiveness of the pruning process. To this end, this paper proposes a game-theoretic framework that formulates layer pruning as a cooperative game in which each layer acts as a player and model performance serves as the utility. As computing exact Shapley values is computationally infeasible for large language models (LLMs), we propose using a lightweight surrogate network to estimate layer-wise marginal contributions. This network can predict LLM performance for arbitrary layer combinations at a low computational cost. Additionally, we employ stratified Monte Carlo mask sampling to further reduce the cost of Sharpley value estimation. This approach captures inter-layer dependencies and dynamically identifies critical layers for pruning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the consistent superiority of our method in terms of perplexity and zero-shot accuracy, achieving more efficient and effective layer-wise pruning for large language models."}

TLC-Plan employs a two-level VQ-VAE to encode global layouts as semantically labeled room bounding boxes and to refine local geometries using polygon-level codes. This hierarchy is unified in a CodeTree representation, while an autoregressive transformer samples codes conditioned on the boundary to generate diverse and topologically valid designs, without requiring explicit room topology or dimensional priors.

Unlike prior approaches that ignore future interventions or directly use large language models (LLMs) for numerical forecasting, EventCast leverages LLMs solely for event-driven reasoning. Unstructured business data, which covers campaigns, holiday schedules, and seller incentives, from existing operational databases, is processed by an LLM that converts it into interpretable textual summaries leveraging world knowledge for cultural nuances and novel event combinations. These summaries are fused with historical demand features within a dual-tower architecture, enabling accurate, explainable, and scalable forecasts. Deployed on real-world e-commerce scenarios spanning 4 countries of 160 regions over 10 months, EventCast achieves up to 86.9% and 97.7% improvement on MAE and MSE compared to the variant without event knowledge, and reduces MAE by up to 57.0% and MSE by 83.3% versus the best industrial baseline during event-driven periods.

We probe the hidden states of several smaller open-source LLMs. A single linear projection of an appropriate hidden layer encodes the log-magnitudes of both kinds of numerals, allowing us to recover the numbers with relative error of about 2.3% (on restricted synthetic text) or 19.06% (on scientific papers). Furthermore, the hidden state after reading a pair of numerals encodes their ranking, with a linear classifier achieving over 90% accuracy. Yet surprisingly, when explicitly asked to rank the same pairs of numerals, these LLMs achieve only 50-70% accuracy, with worse performance for models whose probes are less effective. Finally, we show that incorporating the classifier probe's log-loss as an auxiliary objective during finetuning brings an additional 3.22% improvement in verbalized accuracy over base models, demonstrating that improving models' internal magnitude representations can enhance their numerical reasoning capabilities."}

Within a high-fidelity simulation grounded in real-world data, our policy is trained to map raw monocular RGB observations directly to continuous control commands. To overcome photometric limitations, we introduce Relightable 3D Gaussian Splatting, which decomposes scene components to enable explicit, physically grounded editing of environmental lighting within the neural representation. By augmenting training with diverse synthesized lighting conditions ranging from strong directional sunlight to diffuse overcast skies, we compel the policy to learn robust, illumination-invariant visual features.

To address this bottleneck, we propose Geo-coder -- the first inverse programming framework for geometric images based on a multi-agent system. Our method innovatively decouples the process into geometric modeling via pixel-wise anchoring and metric-driven code evolution: Stage 1 leverages the complementary advantages of visual operators and large models to achieve precise capture of pixel coordinates and visual attributes; Stage 2 introduces a synthesis-rendering-validation closed loop, where bidirectional visual feedback drives the self-correction of code. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Geo-coder achieves a substantial lead in both geometric reconstruction accuracy and visual consistency. Notably, by effectively preserving the core geometric semantics, the images reconstructed with our method exhibit equivalent performance to the original ones in multimodal reasoning tasks, which fully validates the robustness of the framework. Finally, to further reduce research costs, we have open-sourced the Geo-coder dataset constructed on the GeoCode framework, which contains more than 1,500 samples.

While prior work has studied prompt injection in the text domain and through digitally edited 2D images, it remains unclear how these attacks function in 3D physical environments. To bridge the gap, we introduce PI3D, a prompt injection attack against MLLMs in 3D environments, realized through text-bearing physical object placement rather than digital image edits. We formulate and solve the problem of identifying an effective 3D object pose (position and orientation) with injected text, where the attacker's goal is to induce the MLLM to perform the injected task while ensuring that the object placement remains physically plausible. Experiments demonstrate that PI3D is an effective attack against multiple MLLMs under diverse camera trajectories. We further evaluate existing defenses and show that they are insufficient to defend against PI3D."}

Experiments across 15 representative calibration methods and four LLM families (7B-72B) reveal that while accuracy increases with answer cardinality, estimated confidence consistently decreases, causing severe miscalibration for questions with mixed answer counts.

A key challenge arises from the representation mismatch between discrete, token-level semantic reasoning in LLMs and the dense, fine-grained temporal dynamics required for 3D facial motion, which makes direct modeling difficult to optimize under limited data. We propose Expressive Omni (Ex-Omni), an open-source omni-modal framework that augments OLLMs with speech-accompanied 3D facial animation. Ex-Omni reduces learning difficulty by decoupling semantic reasoning from temporal generation, leveraging speech units as temporal scaffolding and a unified token-as-query gated fusion (TQGF) mechanism for controlled semantic injection. We further introduce InstructEx, a dataset aims to facilitate augment OLLMs with speech-accompanied 3D facial animation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Ex-Omni performs competitively against existing open-source OLLMs while enabling stable aligned speech and facial animation generation."}

To address this limitation, agentic systems commonly incorporate memory modules to retain and reuse past experience, aiming for continual learning during test time. However, most existing memory designs are human-crafted and fixed, which limits their ability to adapt to the diversity and non-stationarity of real-world tasks. In this paper, we introduce ALMA (Automated meta-Learning of Memory designs for Agentic systems), a framework that meta-learns memory designs to replace hand-engineered memory designs, therefore minimizing human effort and enabling agentic systems to be continual learners across diverse domains. Our approach employs a Meta Agent that searches over memory designs expressed as executable code in an open-ended manner, theoretically allowing the discovery of arbitrary memory designs, including database schemas as well as their retrieval and update mechanisms. Extensive experiments across four sequential decision-making domains demonstrate that the learned memory designs enable more effective and efficient learning from experience than state-of-the-art human-crafted memory designs on all benchmarks. When developed and deployed safely, ALMA represents a step toward self-improving AI systems that learn to be adaptive, continual learners."}

Via causal mediation, we identify that instruction representation is fairly localized in models. These representations, which we call Instruction Vectors (IVs), demonstrate a curious juxtaposition of linear separability along with non-linear causal interaction, broadly questioning the scope of the linear representation hypothesis commonplace in mechanistic interpretability. To disentangle the non-linear causal interaction, we propose a novel method to localize information processing in language models that is free from the implicit linear assumptions of patching-based techniques.

Project page: https://lhyfst.github.io/balancehead/", "summary": "Conditioning is crucial for stable training of full-head 3D GANs. Without any conditioning signal, the model suffers from severe mode collapse, making it impractical to training. However, a series of previous full-head 3D GANs conventionally choose the view angle as the conditioning input, which leads to a bias in the learned 3D full-head space along the conditional view direction. This is evident in the significant differences in generation quality and diversity between the conditional view and non-conditional views of the generated 3D heads, resulting in global incoherence across different head regions. In this work, we propose to use view-invariant semantic feature as the conditioning input, thereby decoupling the generative capability of 3D heads from the viewing direction. To construct a view-invariant semantic condition for each training image, we create a novel synthesized head image dataset. We leverage FLUX.1 Kontext to extend existing high-quality frontal face datasets to a wide range of view angles. The image clip feature extracted from the frontal view is then used as a shared semantic condition across all views in the extended images, ensuring semantic alignment while eliminating directional bias. This also allows supervision from different views of the same subject to be consolidated under a shared semantic condition, which accelerates training and enhances the global coherence of the generated 3D heads. Moreover, as GANs often experience slower improvements in diversity once the generator learns a few modes that successfully fool the discriminator, our semantic conditioning encourages the generator to follow the true semantic distribution, thereby promoting continuous learning and diverse generation. Extensive experiments on full-head synthesis and single-view GAN inversion demonstrate that our method achieves significantly higher fidelity, diversity, and generalizability."}

A Comparative Study on the Cross-Lingual Transfer of Composite Harms", "comment": "Accepted at the AICS Workshop, AAAI 2026", "summary": "Most safety evaluations of large language models (LLMs) remain anchored in English. Translation is often used as a shortcut to probe multilingual behavior, but it rarely captures the full picture, especially when harmful intent or structure morphs across languages. Some types of harm survive translation almost intact, while others distort or disappear. To study this effect, we introduce CompositeHarm, a translation-based benchmark designed to examine how safety alignment holds up as both syntax and semantics shift. It combines two complementary English datasets, AttaQ, which targets structured adversarial attacks, and MMSafetyBench, which covers contextual, real-world harms, and extends them into six languages: English, Hindi, Assamese, Marathi, Kannada, and Gujarati. Using three large models, we find that attack success rates rise sharply in Indic languages, especially under adversarial syntax, while contextual harms transfer more moderately. To ensure scalability and energy efficiency, our study adopts lightweight inference strategies inspired by edge-AI design principles, reducing redundant evaluation passes while preserving cross-lingual fidelity. This design makes large-scale multilingual safety testing both computationally feasible and environmentally conscious. Overall, our results show that translated benchmarks are a necessary first step, but not a sufficient one, toward building grounded, resource-aware, language-adaptive safety systems."}

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs), especially their reasoning abilities unlocked through reinforcement learning (RL), have opened new opportunities for tackling tasks with long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, leveraging LLM reasoning for time series remains in its infancy, hindered by the absence of carefully curated time series CoT data for training, limited data efficiency caused by underexplored data scheduling, and the lack of RL algorithms tailored for exploiting such time series CoT data. In this paper, we introduce VeriTime, a framework that tailors LLMs for time series reasoning through data synthesis, data scheduling, and RL training. First, we propose a data synthesis pipeline that constructs a TS-text multimodal dataset with process-verifiable annotations.

A faithful judge should base its verdicts solely on content quality, remain invariant to irrelevant context, and transparently reflect the factors driving its decisions. We test this ideal via controlled cue perturbations-synthetic metadata labels injected into evaluation prompts-for six judge models: GPT-4o, Gemini-2.0-Flash, Gemma-3-27B, Qwen3-235B, Claude-3-Haiku, and Llama3-70B. Experiments span two complementary datasets with distinct evaluation regimes: ELI5 (factual QA) and LitBench (open-ended creative writing). We study six cue families: source, temporal, age, gender, ethnicity, and educational status. Beyond measuring verdict shift rates (VSR), we introduce cue acknowledgment rate (CAR) to quantify whether judges explicitly reference the injected cues in their natural-language rationales. Across cues with strong behavioral effects-e.g., provenance hierarchies (Expert > Human > LLM > Unknown), recency preferences (New > Old), and educational-status favoritism-CAR is typically at or near zero, indicating that shortcut reliance is largely unreported even when it drives decisions. Crucially, CAR is also dataset-dependent: explicit cue recognition is more likely to surface in the factual ELI5 setting for some models and cues, but often collapses in the open-ended LitBench regime, where large verdict shifts can persist despite zero acknowledgment. The combination of substantial verdict sensitivity and limited cue acknowledgment reveals an explanation gap in LLM-as-judge pipelines, raising concerns about reliability of model-based evaluation in both research and deployment."}

Concerningly, a pre-registered survey of experts failed to predict this result, highlighting our poor understanding of the inductive biases governing learning and generalisation in LLMs. We use emergent misalignment (EM) as a case study to investigate these inductive biases and find that models can just learn the narrow dataset task, but that the general solution appears to be more stable and more efficient. To establish this, we build on the result that different EM finetunes converge to the same linear representation of general misalignment, which can be used to mediate misaligned behaviour. We find a linear representation of the narrow solution also exists, and can be learned by introducing a KL divergence loss. Comparing these representations reveals that general misalignment achieves lower loss, is more robust to perturbations, and is more influential in the pre-training distribution.

Existing compression and eviction methods often struggle to balance accuracy, compression ratio, and hardware efficiency. We propose DeltaKV, a residual-based KV cache compression framework motivated by two empirical findings: long-range inter-token similarity and highly shared latent components in KV representations. Instead of discarding tokens, DeltaKV encodes semantic residuals relative to retrieved historical references, preserving fidelity while substantially reducing storage. To translate compression gains into real system speedups, we further introduce Sparse-vLLM, a high-performance inference engine with decoupled memory management and kernels optimized for sparse and irregular KV layouts. Experiments show that DeltaKV reduces KV cache memory to 29\\% of the original while maintaining near-lossless accuracy on LongBench, SCBench, and AIME. When integrated with Sparse-vLLM, it achieves up to 2$\\times$ throughput improvement over vLLM in long-context scenarios, demonstrating a practical path toward scalable long-context LLM deployment.

To transcend these limitations, we propose ToolSelf, a novel paradigm enabling tool-driven runtime self-reconfiguration. By abstracting configuration updates as a callable tool, ToolSelf unifies task execution and self-adjustment into a single action space, achieving a phase transition from external rules to intrinsic parameters. Agents can thereby autonomously update their sub-goals and context based on task progression, and correspondingly adapt their strategy and toolbox, transforming from passive executors into dual managers of both task and self. We further devise Configuration-Aware Two-stage Training (CAT), combining rejection sampling fine-tuning with trajectory-level reinforcement learning to internalize this meta-capability. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that ToolSelf rivals specialized workflows while generalizing to novel tasks, achieving a 24.1% average performance gain and illuminating a path toward truly self-adaptive agents."}

From 17 generated video frames, our LRM performs single-pass inference to predict neural material parameters that generalize to novel viewing and lighting conditions.

Given their diverse designs, we first place representative metric-based methods within a unified framework, enabling a clear assessment of their advantages and limitations. Our analysis identifies a core challenge across these methods: the token-level detection score is easily biased by the inherent randomness of the MGTs generation process. To address this, we theoretically and empirically reveal two relationships of context detection scores that may aid calibration: Neighbor Similarity and Initial Instability. We then propose a Markov-informed score calibration strategy that models these relationships using Markov random fields, and implements it as a lightweight component via a mean-field approximation, allowing our method to be seamlessly integrated into existing detectors.

We introduce Cross-View World Models (XVWM), trained with a cross-view prediction objective: given a sequence of frames from one viewpoint, predict the future state from the same or a different viewpoint after an action is taken. Enforcing cross-view consistency acts as geometric regularization: because the input and output views may share little or no visual overlap, to predict across viewpoints, the model must learn view-invariant representations of the environment's 3D structure. We train on synchronized multi-view gameplay data from Aimlabs, an aim-training platform providing precisely aligned multi-camera recordings with high-frequency action labels. The resulting model gives agents parallel imagination streams across viewpoints, enabling planning in whichever frame of reference best suits the task while executing from the egocentric view. Our results show that multi-view consistency provides a strong learning signal for spatially grounded representations. Finally, predicting the consequences of one's actions from another viewpoint may offer a foundation for perspective-taking in multi-agent settings."}

However, studies find that these methods always propagate the information to very limited neighborhoods with shallow depth, particularly due to over-smoothing. That means most of the existing MPNNs fail to be so `deep'. Although some previous work tended to handle this challenge via optimization- or structure-level remedies, the overall performance of GCNs still suffers from limited accuracy, poor stability, and unaffordable computational cost. Moreover, neglect of higher-order relationships during the propagation of MPNNs has further limited the performance of them. To overcome these challenges, a novel variant of PageRank named motif-based personalized PageRank (MPPR) is proposed to measure the influence of one node to another on the basis of considering higher-order motif relationships. Secondly, the MPPR is utilized to the message passing process of GCNs, thereby guiding the message passing process at a relatively `high' level. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms almost all of the baselines on accuracy, stability, and time consumption. Additionally, the proposed method can be considered as a component that can underpin almost all GCN tasks, with DGCRL being demonstrated in the experiment.

We introduce TDGNet, a temporal dynamic graph framework that formulates hallucination detection as learning over evolving token-level attention graphs. At each denoising step, we sparsify the attention graph and update per-token memories via message passing, then apply temporal attention to aggregate trajectory-wide evidence for final prediction. Experiments on LLaDA-8B and Dream-7B across QA benchmarks show consistent AUROC improvements over output-based, latent-based, and static-graph baselines, with single-pass inference and modest overhead.

While existing studies augment LLMs with various knowledge types, it remains unclear how effectively the additional costs translate into accuracy. In this paper, we explore how meta-cognition of LLMs, i.e., their self-awareness of their own knowledge states, can regulate the reasoning process. Specifically, we propose MedCoG, a Medical Meta-Cognition Agent with Knowledge Graph, where the meta-cognitive assessments of task complexity, familiarity, and knowledge density dynamically regulate utilization of procedural, episodic, and factual knowledge. The LLM-centric on-demand reasoning aims to mitigate scaling laws by (1) reducing costs via avoiding indiscriminate scaling, (2) improving accuracy via filtering out distractive knowledge. To validate this, we empirically characterize the scaling curve and introduce inference density to quantify inference efficiency, defined as the ratio of theoretically effective cost to actual cost. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of MedCoG on five hard sets of medical benchmarks, yielding 5.5x inference density. Furthermore, the Oracle study highlights the significant potential of meta-cognitive regulation."}

Deliberation follows a consistent trajectory: an exploration phase where probability mass spreads across candidates, tentative commitment to a frontrunner, and either convergence or backtracking. Backtracking is prevalent (32% of instances), beneficial (34% accuracy gain over non-backtracking instances), and predominantly directed away from the semantically closest distractor toward the correct answer.

To this end, the optimization environment uses a domain-specific language for image processing to iterate on solutions. Programs in this language are a list of image-filtering blocks with tunable parameters that sequentially process an input image, allowing for reliable generation and mutation by a genetic algorithm. Our environment produces optimized human-interpretable MATLAB code representing an image filtering pipeline.

Although leveraging pretrained models (PTMs) has greatly advanced conventional continual learning (CL), these methods remain limited in reconciling the diverse and temporally mixed information along a single pass, resulting in sub-optimal GCL performance. Inspired by meta-plasticity and reconstructive memory in neuroscience, we introduce here an innovative approach named Meta Post-Refinement (MePo) for PTMs-based GCL. This approach constructs pseudo task sequences from pretraining data and develops a bi-level meta-learning paradigm to refine the pretrained backbone, which serves as a prolonged pretraining phase but greatly facilitates rapid adaptation of representation learning to downstream GCL tasks. MePo further initializes a meta covariance matrix as the reference geometry of pretrained representation space, enabling GCL to exploit second-order statistics for robust output alignment.

While generally structured, these documents are often dense, bureaucratic, and highly heterogeneous across municipalities, exhibiting significant variation in language, terminology, structure, and overall organization. This heterogeneity makes them difficult for non-experts to interpret and challenging for intelligent automated systems to process, limiting public transparency and civic engagement. To address these challenges, computational methods can be employed to structure and interpret such complex documents. In particular, Natural Language Processing (NLP) offers well-established methods that can enhance the accessibility and interpretability of governmental records. In this focus article, we review foundational NLP tasks that support the structuring of local governance meeting documents. Specifically, we review three core tasks: document segmentation, domain-specific entity extraction and automatic text summarization, which are essential for navigating lengthy deliberations, identifying political actors and personal information, and generating concise representations of complex decision-making processes. In reviewing these tasks, we discuss methodological approaches, evaluation metrics, and publicly available resources, while highlighting domain-specific challenges such as data scarcity, privacy constraints, and source variability. By synthesizing existing work across these foundational tasks, this article provides a structured overview of how NLP can enhance the structuring and accessibility of local governance meeting records."}

In this work, we propose a unified optimization framework that reinterprets prior art as implicit strategies to avoid these corrupted regions. Based on this insight, we introduce Adaptive Matching Distillation (AMD), a self-correcting mechanism that utilizes reward proxies to explicitly detect and escape Forbidden Zones. AMD dynamically prioritizes corrective gradients via structural signal decomposition and introduces Repulsive Landscape Sharpening to enforce steep energy barriers against failure mode collapse. Extensive experiments across image and video generation tasks (e.g., SDXL, Wan2.1) and rigorous benchmarks (e.g., VBench, GenEval) demonstrate that AMD significantly enhances sample fidelity and training robustness. For instance, AMD improves the HPSv2 score on SDXL from 30.64 to 31.25, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. These findings validate that explicitly rectifying optimization trajectories within Forbidden Zones is essential for pushing the performance ceiling of few-step generative models."}

However, as the amount of context grows, their reliability often deteriorates, a phenomenon known as \"context rot\". Existing long-context benchmarks primarily focus on single-step settings that evaluate a model's ability to retrieve information from a long snippet. In realistic scenarios, however, LLMs often need to act as agents that explore environments, follow instructions and plans, extract useful information, and predict correct actions under a dynamically growing context. To assess language agents in such settings, we introduce LOCA-bench (a benchmark for LOng-Context Agents). Given a task prompt, LOCA-bench leverages automated and scalable control of environment states to regulate the agent's context length. This design enables LOCA-bench to extend the context length potentially to infinity in a controlled way while keeping the underlying task semantics fixed. LOCA-bench evaluates language agents as a combination of models and scaffolds, including various context management strategies. While agent performance generally degrades as the environment states grow more complex, advanced context management techniques can substantially improve the overall success rate. We open-source LOCA-bench to provide a platform for evaluating models and scaffolds in long-context, agentic scenarios: https://github.com/hkust-nlp/LOCA-bench"}

Both humans and LLMs display evidence of convention-formation (increasing the accuracy and consistency of their turns while decreasing their length) when communicating in same-type dyads (humans with humans, AI with AI). However, heterogenous human-AI pairs fail -- suggesting differences in communicative tendencies. In Experiment 2, we ask whether LLMs can be induced to behave more like human conversants, by prompting them to produce superficially humanlike behavior. While the length of their messages matches that of human pairs, accuracy and lexical overlap in human-LLM pairs continues to lag behind that of both human-human and AI-AI pairs. These results suggest that conversational alignment requires more than just the ability to mimic previous interactions, but also shared interpretative biases toward the meanings that are conveyed."}

While recent data-driven methods promise to accelerate parts of this process, they largely fail to support end-to-end scientific discovery. To address this gap, we introduce EXPERIGEN, an agentic framework that operationalizes end-to-end discovery through a Bayesian optimization inspired two-phase search, in which a Generator proposes candidate hypotheses and an Experimenter evaluates them empirically. Across multiple domains, EXPERIGEN consistently discovers 2-4x more statistically significant hypotheses that are 7-17 percent more predictive than prior approaches, and naturally extends to complex data regimes including multimodal and relational datasets. Beyond statistical performance, hypotheses must be novel, empirically grounded, and actionable to drive real scientific progress. To evaluate these qualities, we conduct an expert review of machine-generated hypotheses, collecting feedback from senior faculty. Among 25 reviewed hypotheses, 88 percent were rated moderately or strongly novel, 70 percent were deemed impactful and worth pursuing, and most demonstrated rigor comparable to senior graduate-level research. Finally, recognizing that ultimate validation requires real-world evidence, we conduct the first A/B test of LLM-generated hypotheses, observing statistically significant results with p less than 1e-6 and a large effect size of 344 percent."}

We propose Pretraining with Token-Level Adaptive Latent CoT (adaptive latent CoT), where the model generates a variable-length latent CoT trajectory before emitting each token -- allocating longer trajectories to difficult tokens and shorter (or even zero) trajectories to easy ones. Importantly, this behavior emerges naturally from one-stage pretraining on general text and reduces computation in both training and inference via token-wise adaptive halting. Experiments with Llama architectures show that adaptive latent CoT consistently improves language modeling perplexity and broad downstream accuracy, even with fewer training FLOPs than prior recurrent baselines."}

In response to this unresolved dilemma, we introduce RAPS, a reputation-aware publish-subscribe paradigm for adaptive, scalable, and robust coordination of LLM agents. RAPS is grounded in the Distributed Publish-Subscribe Protocol, allowing LLM agents to exchange messages based on their declared intents rather than predefined topologies. Beyond this substrate, RAPS further incorporates two coherent overlays: (i) Reactive Subscription, enabling agents to dynamically refine their intents; and (ii) Bayesian Reputation, empowering each agent with a local watchdog to detect and isolate malicious peers. Extensive experiments over five benchmarks showcase that our design effectively reconciles adaptivity, scalability, and robustness in a unified multi-agent coordination framework."}

Through layer-wise analysis, we attribute this failure to a parametric suppression phenomenon: specifically, in deep layers, certain FFN layers overwrite context-sensitive representations with memorized priors. To address this, we propose CoRect (Context-Aware Logit Contrast for Hidden State Rectification). By contrasting logits from contextualized and non-contextualized forward passes, CoRect identifies layers that exhibit high parametric bias without requiring ground-truth labels. It then rectifies the hidden states to preserve evidence-grounded information. Across question answering (QA) and summarization benchmarks, CoRect consistently improves faithfulness and reduces hallucinations compared to strong baselines."}

Since clinical decision-making is inherently collaborative, we challenge the monolithic scaling paradigm and ask whether a Small Agent Group (SAG) can support better clinical reasoning. SAG shifts from single-model intelligence to collective expertise by distributing reasoning, evidence-based analysis, and critical audit through a collaborative deliberation process. To assess the clinical utility of SAG, we conduct extensive evaluations using diverse clinical metrics spanning effectiveness, reliability, and deployment cost. Our results show that SAG achieves superior performance compared to a single giant model, both with and without additional optimization or retrieval-augmented generation. These findings suggest that the synergistic reasoning represented by SAG can substitute for model parameter growth in clinical settings. Overall, SAG offers a scalable solution to digital health that better balances effectiveness, reliability, and deployment efficiency."}

To fill this gap, we introduce the first conceptual and methodological framework for unintended CUA behaviors, by defining their key characteristics, automatically eliciting them, and analyzing how they arise from benign inputs. We propose AutoElicit: an agentic framework that iteratively perturbs benign instructions using CUA execution feedback, and elicits severe harms while keeping perturbations realistic and benign. Using AutoElicit, we surface hundreds of harmful unintended behaviors from state-of-the-art CUAs such as Claude 4.5 Haiku and Opus. We further evaluate the transferability of human-verified successful perturbations, identifying persistent susceptibility to unintended behaviors across various other frontier CUAs.

This structure naturally embeds feature relationships into the search process, eliminating the need for additional constraints to ensure consistency with the model's structural assumptions. We adopt a convergence-guaranteed cutting-set procedure as an adversarial optimization framework, which iteratively approximates solutions that satisfy global robustness conditions. To address the nonconvex quadratic structure induced by feature dependencies, we apply piecewise McCormick relaxation to reformulate the problem as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP), ensuring global optimality.

This training paradigm enables the model to capture global narrative coherence, significantly boosting long-context performance. We validate the effectiveness of our method on two widely used benchmarks, RULER and LongBench~v2. While acquiring noticeable gains on RULER, it can also achieve a reasonable improvement on LongBench~v2 without any manually curated long-context QA data.

By iteratively switching between reasoning and cleaning modes, Free()LM dynamically identifies and prunes useless context chunks, maintaining a compact and noise-free state.\n  Extensive experiments show that Free()LM provides consistent improvements across all model scales (8B to 685B).

We address this gap by combining analytical and empirical analyses that build on the Information Bottleneck (IB) framework for semantic efficiency. First, we show that convexity and efficiency are distinct in the sense that neither entails the other: there are convex systems which are inefficient, and optimally-efficient systems that are non-convex. Crucially, however, the IB-optimal systems are mostly convex in the domain of color naming, explaining the main empirical basis for the convexity approach. Second, we show that efficiency is a stronger predictor for discriminating attested color naming systems from hypothetical variants, with convexity adding negligible improvement on top of that. Finally, we discuss a range of empirical phenomena that convexity cannot account for but efficiency can. Taken together, our work suggests that while convexity and efficiency can yield similar structural observations, they are fundamentally distinct, with efficiency providing a more comprehensive account of semantic typology."}

The GNN effectively represents the complex state of jobs, machines, and setups, allowing the PPO agent to learn a direct scheduling policy. Guided by a multi-objective reward function, the agent simultaneously minimizes TWT and TST. Experimental results on benchmark instances demonstrate that our PPO-GNN agent significantly outperforms a standard dispatching rule and a metaheuristic, achieving a superior trade-off between both objectives.

Across datasets from the United Kingdom and Singapore, this approach outperforms existing methods in predicting validated fusion scores. Applied to extremist manifestos, two distinct high-fusion pathways to violence emerge: ideologues tend to frame themselves in terms of group, forming kinship bonds; whereas grievance-driven individuals frame the group in terms of their personal identity.

AI models for biology are trained on large volumes of data, including data related to biological sequences, structures, images, and functions.

For this reason, an international group of more than 100 researchers at the recent 50th anniversary Asilomar Conference endorsed data controls to prevent the use of AI for harmful applications such as bioweapons development. To help design such controls, we introduce a five-tier Biosecurity Data Level (BDL) framework for categorizing pathogen data. Each level contains specific data types, based on their expected ability to contribute to capabilities of concern when used to train AI models. For each BDL tier, we propose technical restrictions appropriate to its level of risk. Finally, we outline a novel governance framework for newly created dual-use pathogen data.

At the heart of this process is not just the ability to communicate but also the remarkable flexibility in how we can express ourselves. We can express the same thoughts in virtually infinite ways using different words and structures - this ability to rephrase and reformulate expressions is known as paraphrase. Modeling paraphrases is a keystone to meaning in computational language models; being able to construct different variations of texts that convey the same meaning or not shows strong abilities of semantic understanding. If computational language models are to represent meaning, they must understand and control the different aspects that construct the same meaning as opposed to different meanings at a fine granularity. Yet most existing approaches reduce paraphrasing to a binary decision between two texts or to producing a single rewrite of a source, obscuring which linguistic factors are responsible for meaning preservation. In this thesis, I propose that decomposing paraphrases into their constituent linguistic aspects (paraphrase types) offers a more fine-grained and cognitively grounded view of semantic equivalence. I show that even advanced machine learning models struggle with this task. Yet, when explicitly trained on paraphrase types, models achieve stronger performance on related paraphrase tasks and downstream applications. For example, in plagiarism detection, language models trained on paraphrase types surpass human baselines: 89.6% accuracy compared to 78.4% for plagiarism cases from Wikipedia, and 66.5% compared to 55.7% for plagiarism of scientific papers from arXiv.

In this paper, we propose a brain-image alignment strategy that leverages multiple pre-trained visual encoders with distinct inductive biases to capture hierarchical and multi-scale visual representations, while employing a contrastive learning objective to achieve effective alignment between brain signals and visual embeddings. Furthermore, we introduce a Fusion Prior, which learns a stable mapping on large-scale visual data and subsequently matches brain features to this pre-trained prior, thereby enhancing distributional consistency across modalities.

We demonstrate that while this dogma holds in static environments, it fails in social settings where evaluators may be sycophantic, lazy, or adversarial. We prove that under Dogma 4, standard RL agents suffer from what we call Objective Decoupling, a structural failure mode where the agent's learned objective permanently separates from the latent ground truth, guaranteeing convergence to misalignment. To resolve this, we propose Epistemic Source Alignment (ESA). Unlike standard robust methods that rely on statistical consensus (trusting the majority), ESA utilizes sparse safety axioms to judge the source of the feedback rather than the signal itself. We prove that this \"judging the judges\" mechanism guarantees convergence to the true objective, even when a majority of evaluators are biased. Empirically, we show that while traditional consensus methods fail under majority collusion, our approach successfully recovers the optimal policy."}

A Probabilistic Perspective on the Emergence of Reasoning in RLVR", "comment": "15 pages", "summary": "Whether Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) endows Large Language Models (LLMs) with new capabilities or merely elicits latent traces remains a central debate. In this work, we align with the former view, proposing a probabilistic framework where capability is defined by instance-level solvability. We hypothesize that the emergence of complex reasoning can be driven by sharpening atomic step probabilities, which enables models to overcome the exponential decay of success rates inherent in multi-step reasoning chains. Utilizing the Algebrarium framework, we train models exclusively on single-step operations and evaluate their performance on unseen multi-step tasks. Our empirical results confirm that: (1) RLVR incentivizes the exploration of previously inaccessible solution paths by amplifying the model's existing skills; (2) composite performance is strictly governed by the joint probability of atomic steps, evidenced by high Pearson correlation coefficients ($ρ\\in [0.69, 0.96]$); and (3) RLVR, acting as a global optimizer, can cause specific skills to be sacrificed to maximize aggregate reward. Our work offers a novel explanation for emergent abilities in RLVR, suggesting that the iterative optimization of solvable problems enables models to develop the capabilities to tackle previously unsolvable scenarios."}

Implicit methods, on the other hand, capture high-level implicit motion semantics directly from the driving video, but suffer from identity leakage and entanglement between motion and appearance. To address the above challenges, we propose a novel implicit motion representation that compresses per-frame motion into compact 1D motion tokens. This design relaxes strict spatial constraints inherent in 2D representations and effectively prevents identity information leakage from the motion video. Furthermore, we design a temporally consistent mask token-based retargeting module that enforces a temporal training bottleneck, mitigating interference from the source images' motion and improving retargeting consistency.

We introduce a two-stage gradient-based framework that provides interpretable diagnostics for three critical failure analysis tasks: (1) detecting the true initial failure source (Patient-0); (2) validating why non-attacked agents may be flagged first due to domino effects; and (3) tracing how failures propagate through learned coordination pathways. Stage 1 performs interpretable per-agent failure detection via Taylor-remainder analysis of policy-gradient costs, declaring an initial Patient-0 candidate at the first threshold crossing. Stage 2 provides validation through geometric analysis of critic derivatives-first-order sensitivity and directional second-order curvature aggregated over causal windows to construct interpretable contagion graphs. This approach explains \"downstream-first\" detection anomalies by revealing pathways that amplify upstream deviations. Evaluated across 500 episodes in Simple Spread (3 and 5 agents) and 100 episodes in StarCraft II using MADDPG and HATRPO, our method achieves 88.2-99.4% Patient-0 detection accuracy while providing interpretable geometric evidence for detection decisions.

In this paper, we propose an entity and relation extraction algorithm based on hypergraph neural network (Legal-KAHRE) for drug-related judgment documents. Firstly, we design a candidate span generator based on neighbor-oriented packing strategy and biaffine mechanism, which identifies spans likely to contain entities. Secondly, we construct a legal dictionary with judicial domain knowledge and integrate it into text encoding representation using multi-head attention. Additionally, we incorporate domain-specific cases like joint crimes and combined punishment for multiple crimes into the hypergraph structure design.

In this work, a simple and efficient adaptive zoom-in framework is explored for object detection on UAV images. The main motivation is that the foreground objects are generally smaller and sparser than those in common scene images, which hinders the optimization of effective object detectors. We thus aim to zoom in adaptively on the objects to better capture object features for the detection task. To achieve the goal, two core designs are required: \\textcolor{black}{i) How to conduct non-uniform zooming on each image efficiently? ii) How to enable object detection training and inference with the zoomed image space?} Correspondingly, a lightweight offset prediction scheme coupled with a novel box-based zooming objective is introduced to learn non-uniform zooming on the input image. Based on the learned zooming transformation, a corner-aligned bounding box transformation method is proposed. The method warps the ground-truth bounding boxes to the zoomed space to learn object detection, and warps the predicted bounding boxes back to the original space during inference. We conduct extensive experiments on three representative UAV object detection datasets, including VisDrone, UAVDT, and SeaDronesSee. The proposed ZoomDet is architecture-independent and can be applied to an arbitrary object detection architecture. Remarkably, on the SeaDronesSee dataset, ZoomDet offers more than 8.4 absolute gain of mAP with a Faster R-CNN model, with only about 3 ms additional latency.

Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) targets these mechanisms but faces scalability challenges. Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) offers potential for delivering personalized DBT coaching at scale, yet rapid development has outpaced safety infrastructure. Methods: We developed Glow, a GenAI-powered DBT skills coach delivering chain and solution analysis for individuals at risk for HIV and substance use. In partnership with a Los Angeles community health organization, we conducted usability testing with clinical staff (n=6) and individuals with lived experience (n=28). Using the Helpful, Honest, and Harmless (HHH) framework, we employed user-driven adversarial testing wherein participants identified target behaviors and generated contextually realistic risk probes. We evaluated safety performance across 37 risk probe interactions. Results: Glow appropriately handled 73% of risk probes, but performance varied by agent. The solution analysis agent demonstrated 90% appropriate handling versus 44% for the chain analysis agent. Safety failures clustered around encouraging substance use and normalizing harmful behaviors. The chain analysis agent fell into an \"empathy trap,\" providing validation that reinforced maladaptive beliefs. Additionally, 27 instances of DBT skill misinformation were identified.

We further show that the contextual correction norm admits an explicit upper bound determined by context-query relevance and complementarity.

As the conclusive written instrument issued by a court, a judgment document embodies complex legal reasoning. However, existing methods often oversimplify this complex process, particularly by omitting the ``Pre-Judge'' phase, a crucial step where human judges form a preliminary conclusion. This omission leads to two core challenges: 1) the ineffective acquisition of foundational judicial elements, and 2) the inadequate modeling of the Pre-Judge process, which collectively undermine the final document's legal soundness.

RJER first retrieves legal articles and a precedent case to establish a referential foundation. ICE then operationalizes the Pre-Judge phase by generating a verifiable intermediate conclusion. Finally, JUS synthesizes these inputs to craft the final judgment.

In this paper, we present a deep learning-based approach for classifying cat breeds using a subset of the Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset, which contains high-resolution images of various domestic breeds. We employed the Global Context Vision Transformer (GCViT) architecture-tiny for cat breed recognition. To improve model generalization, we used extensive data augmentation, including rotation, horizontal flipping, and brightness adjustment. Experimental results show that the GCViT-Tiny model achieved a test accuracy of 92.00% and validation accuracy of 94.54%. These findings highlight the effectiveness of transformer-based architectures for fine-grained image classification tasks. Potential applications include veterinary diagnostics, animal shelter management, and mobile-based breed recognition systems.

Our empirical analysis reveals an alarming inconsistency in existing evaluations: the standard deviation across ten repeated runs of a single model on HumanEval (1.67) actually exceeds the performance gap among the top-10 models on the official leaderboard (0.91), rendering current rankings statistically precarious. To mitigate these instabilities, we propose a decentralized evaluation framework that enables hardware and parameter diversity through large-scale benchmarking across heterogeneous compute nodes. By leveraging the blockchain-based protocol, the framework incentivizes global contributors to act as independent validators, using a robust reward system to ensure evaluation integrity and discourage dishonest participation. This collective verification transforms evaluation from a \"centralized black box\" into a \"decentralized endorsement\" where multi-party consensus and diverse inference environments yield a more stable, representative metric. Experimental results demonstrate that the decentralized evaluation framework reduces the standard deviation across ten runs on the same model to 0.28. This significant improvement over conventional frameworks ensures higher statistical confidence in model rankings. We have completely implemented this platform and will soon release it to the community."}

Most existing methods focus on the single-intent SLU, where each utterance only has one intent. However, in real-world scenarios users usually express multiple intents in an utterance, which poses a challenge for existing dialogue systems and datasets. In this paper, we propose a generative framework to simultaneously address multiple intent detection and slot filling. In particular, an attention-over-attention decoder is proposed to handle the variable number of intents and the interference between the two sub-tasks by incorporating an inductive bias into the process of multi-task learning. Besides, we construct two new multi-intent SLU datasets based on single-intent utterances by taking advantage of the next sentence prediction (NSP) head of the BERT model. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed attention-over-attention generative model achieves state-of-the-art performance on two public datasets, MixATIS and MixSNIPS, and our constructed datasets."}

However, single time-point segmentations fail to capture the biological heterogeneity and temporal evolution of stroke. We propose a bi-temporal analysis framework that characterizes ischemic tissue using statistical descriptors, radiomic texture features, and deep feature embeddings from two architectures (mJ-Net and nnU-Net). Bi-temporal refers to admission (T1) and post-treatment follow-up (T2). All features are extracted at T1 from CTP, with follow-up DWI aligned to ensure spatial correspondence. Manually delineated masks at T1 and T2 are intersected to construct six regions of interest (ROIs) encoding both initial tissue state and final outcome. Features were aggregated per region and analyzed in feature space. Evaluation on 18 patients with successful reperfusion demonstrated meaningful clustering of region-level representations. Regions classified as penumbra or healthy at T1 that ultimately recovered exhibited feature similarity to preserved brain tissue, whereas infarct-bound regions formed distinct groupings. Both baseline GLCM and deep embeddings showed a similar trend: penumbra regions exhibit features that are significantly different depending on final state, whereas this difference is not significant for core regions. Deep feature spaces, particularly mJ-Net, showed strong separation between salvageable and non-salvageable tissue, with a penumbra separation index that differed significantly from zero (Wilcoxon signed-rank test). These findings suggest that encoder-derived feature manifolds reflect underlying tissue phenotypes and state transitions, providing insight into imaging-based quantification of stroke evolution."}

Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer an energy-efficient alternative due to their event-driven nature; however, their integration with continuous Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) representations is fundamentally challenged by distribution mismatch, where high-dynamic-range embeddings degrade the information coding capacity of threshold-based neurons. To resolve this, we propose Prompt-Tuned Spiking Neural Networks (PTS-SNN), a parameter-efficient neuromorphic adaptation framework that aligns frozen SSL backbones with spiking dynamics. Specifically, we introduce a Temporal Shift Spiking Encoder to capture local temporal dependencies via parameter-free channel shifts, establishing a stable feature basis. To bridge the domain gap, we devise a Context-Aware Membrane Potential Calibration strategy. This mechanism leverages a Spiking Sparse Linear Attention module to aggregate global semantic context into learnable soft prompts, which dynamically regulate the bias voltages of Parametric Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (PLIF) neurons. This regulation effectively centers the heterogeneous input distribution within the responsive firing range, mitigating functional silence or saturation. Extensive experiments on five multilingual datasets (e.g., IEMOCAP, CASIA, EMODB) demonstrate that PTS-SNN achieves 73.34\\% accuracy on IEMOCAP, comparable to competitive Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), while requiring only 1.19M trainable parameters and 0.35 mJ inference energy per sample."}

This has two key advantages. First, it captures the recurrent nature of CoT, but where the thought tokens are generated as input is processing. Second, since the thoughts are represented as tokens, they can be learned from natural language supervision, and using teacher-forcing, which is parallelizable. Empirically, Thinking States outperforms other latent reasoning methods on multiple reasoning tasks, narrowing the gap to CoT on math problems, and matching its performance on 2-Hop QA with improved latency. On state-tracking tasks, we show Thinking States leads to stronger reasoning behavior than CoT, successfully extrapolating to longer sequences than seen during training."}

As a result, learning reliable diagnostic representations becomes difficult, which limits their applicability in medical scenarios with limited paired data. To address this issue, we propose an LLM-Guided Diagnostic Evidence Alignment method (LGDEA), which shifts the pretraining objective toward evidence-level alignment that is more consistent with the medical diagnostic process. Specifically, we leverage LLMs to extract key diagnostic evidence from radiology reports and construct a shared diagnostic evidence space, enabling evidence-aware cross-modal alignment and allowing LGDEA to effectively exploit abundant unpaired medical images and reports, thereby substantially alleviating the reliance on paired data. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves consistent and significant improvements on phrase grounding, image--text retrieval, and zero-shot classification, and even rivals pretraining methods that rely on substantial paired data."}

We argue that this limitation stems from inadequate credit assignment for visual attention during training. To address this issue, we propose SAYO, a visual reasoning model trained with a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that introduces a region-level visual attention-based reward. This reward explicitly aligns optimization signals with visually grounded reasoning steps, enabling the model to learn more reliable attention behaviors. Extensive experiments across multiple multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that SAYO consistently improves performance on diverse reasoning and perception tasks."}

We present UReason, a diagnostic benchmark for reasoning-driven image generation that evaluates whether reasoning can be faithfully executed in pixels. UReason contains 2,000 instances across five task families: Code, Arithmetic, Spatial, Attribute, and Text reasoning. To isolate the role of reasoning traces, we introduce an evaluation framework comparing direct generation, reasoning-guided generation, and de-contextualized generation which conditions only on the refined prompt. Across eight open-source unified models, we observe a consistent Reasoning Paradox: Reasoning traces generally improve performance over direct generation, yet retaining intermediate thoughts as conditioning context often hinders visual synthesis, and conditioning only on the refined prompt yields substantial gains. Our analysis suggests that the bottleneck lies in contextual interference rather than insufficient reasoning capacity. UReason provides a principled testbed for studying reasoning in unified models and motivates future methods that effectively integrate reasoning for visual generation while mitigating interference."}

Slot attention is a popular approach that represents individual objects as latent vectors, called slots. Current methods obtain these slot representations solely from the last layer of a pre-trained vision transformer (ViT), ignoring valuable, semantically rich information encoded across the other layers. To better utilize this latent semantic information, we introduce MUFASA, a lightweight plug-and-play framework for slot attention-based approaches to unsupervised object segmentation. Our model computes slot attention across multiple feature layers of the ViT encoder, fully leveraging their semantic richness. We propose a fusion strategy to aggregate slots obtained on multiple layers into a unified object-centric representation. Integrating MUFASA into existing OCL methods improves their segmentation results across multiple datasets, setting a new state of the art while simultaneously improving training convergence with only minor inference overhead."}

Such designs offer limited capacity for structural exploration, making it difficult to escape deep local optima in complex Combinatorial Optimization Problems (COPs). In this work, we propose G-LNS, a generative evolutionary framework that extends LLM-based AHD to the automated design of Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) operators. Unlike prior methods that evolve heuristics in isolation, G-LNS leverages LLMs to co-evolve tightly coupled pairs of destroy and repair operators. A cooperative evaluation mechanism explicitly captures their interaction, enabling the discovery of complementary operator logic that jointly performs effective structural disruption and reconstruction. Extensive experiments on challenging COP benchmarks, such as Traveling Salesman Problems (TSP) and Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problems (CVRP), demonstrate that G-LNS significantly outperforms LLM-based AHD methods as well as strong classical solvers. The discovered heuristics not only achieve near-optimal solutions with reduced computational budgets but also exhibit robust generalization across diverse and unseen instance distributions."}

Our results across binary, multi-class, and cross-domain (CDFSS) benchmarks demonstrate that this minimal approach, applied to the final backbone layer, is highly competitive with specialized methods involving complex decoders or test-time adaptation.

This characterizes a \"Semantic Selection Gap\" in Foundation Models, a disconnect where traditional heuristics fail to reliably identify high-fidelity features.

To evaluate the quality of the dataset and its impact on emotion classification, eight pre-trained Transformer-based models were evaluated under three preprocessing strategies: preserving original emojis with rule-based normalization, converting emojis into textual descriptions, and applying ViSoLex, a model-based lexical normalization system. Results show that converting emojis into text often improves the performance of several BERT-based baselines, while preserving emojis yields the best results for ViSoBERT and CafeBERT. In contrast, removing emojis generally leads to lower performance. ViSoBERT achieved the highest Macro F1-score of 61.50% and Weighted F1-score of 63.26%.

The framework segments long inputs into chunks and encodes each chunk into compressed memory representations using a learned compressor. A gating module dynamically selects relevant memory blocks, which are then iteratively processed by a reasoning module with an evolving working memory to solve downstream tasks. The compressor and reasoner are jointly optimized via end-to-end reinforcement learning, while the gating module is trained separately as a classifier. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves competitive accuracy on multi-hop reasoning benchmarks such as RULER-HQA, extrapolates context length from 7K to 1.75M tokens, and offers a favorable accuracy-efficiency trade-off compared to strong long-context baselines.

To this end, we propose a compact 3B-parameter Vision-Language-Action (VLA) agent that performs human-like embodied reasoning for both object recognition and action selection, removing the need for stitched multi-model pipelines.

However, we identify a fundamental mismatch between MoE architectures and diffusion-based decoding. Specifically, a large number of experts are activated at each denoising step, while only a small subset of tokens is ultimately accepted, resulting in substantial inference overhead and limiting their deployment in latency-sensitive applications. In this work, we propose TEAM, a plug-and-play framework that accelerates MoE dLLMs by enabling more accepted tokens with fewer activated experts. TEAM is motivated by the observation that expert routing decisions exhibit strong temporal consistency across denoising levels as well as spatial consistency across token positions. Leveraging these properties, TEAM employs three complementary expert activation and decoding strategies, conservatively selecting necessary experts for decoded and masked tokens and simultaneously performing aggressive speculative exploration across multiple candidates. Experimental results demonstrate that TEAM achieves up to 2.2x speedup over vanilla MoE dLLM, with negligible performance degradation.

SIGMA introduces selective multi-attribute tokens, including style, content, subject, and identity tokens, which allow the model to interpret and compose multiple visual conditions in an interleaved text-image sequence. Through post-training on the Bagel unified backbone with 700K interleaved examples, SIGMA supports compositional editing, selective attribute transfer, and fine-grained multimodal alignment. Extensive experiments show that SIGMA improves controllability, cross-condition consistency, and visual quality across diverse editing and generation tasks, with substantial gains over Bagel on compositional tasks."}

Whereas machine learning has been described as the automation of automation, generative AI operates by navigating contextual, semantic, and stylistic coherence rather than optimizing predefined objective metrics. This paper introduces the concept of Vibe-Automation to characterize this transition.\n  The central claim is that the significance of GenAI lies in its functional access to operationalized tacit regularities: context-sensitive patterns embedded in practice that cannot be fully specified through explicit algorithmic rules. Although generative systems do not possess tacit knowledge in a phenomenological sense, they operationalize sensitivities to tone, intent, and situated judgment encoded in high-dimensional latent representations. On this basis, the human role shifts from algorithmic problem specification toward Vibe-Engineering, understood as the orchestration of alignment and contextual judgment in generative systems.\n  The paper connects this epistemological shift to educational and institutional transformation by proposing a conceptual framework structured across three analytical levels and three domains of action: faculty worldview, industry relations, and curriculum design. The risks of mode collapse and cultural homogenization are briefly discussed, emphasizing the need for deliberate engagement with generative systems to avoid regression toward synthetic uniformity."}

Existing methods typically employ coarse-grained attention as a proxy for block importance estimation, but often resort to expensive token-level searching or scoring, resulting in significant selection overhead. In this work, we trace the inaccuracy of standard coarse-grained attention via mean pooling to a theoretical root cause: the interaction between mean pooling and Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE). We prove that mean pooling acts as a low-pass filter that induces destructive interference in high-frequency dimensions, effectively creating a \"blind spot\" for local positional information (e.g., slash patterns). To address this, we introduce Prism, a training-free spectral-aware approach that decomposes block selection into high-frequency and low-frequency branches. By applying energy-based temperature calibration, Prism restores the attenuated positional signals directly from pooled representations, enabling block importance estimation using purely block-level operations, thereby improving efficiency. Extensive evaluations confirm that Prism maintains accuracy parity with full attention while delivering up to $\\mathbf{5.1\\times}$ speedup."}

While prior studies have explored sycophantic behavior in general contexts, its impact on morally grounded visual decision-making remains insufficiently understood. To address this gap, we present the first systematic study of moral sycophancy in VLMs, analyzing ten widely-used models on the Moralise and M^3oralBench datasets under explicit user disagreement. Our results reveal that VLMs frequently produce morally incorrect follow-up responses even when their initial judgments are correct, and exhibit a consistent asymmetry: models are more likely to shift from morally right to morally wrong judgments than the reverse when exposed to user-induced bias. Follow-up prompts generally degrade performance on Moralise, while yielding mixed or even improved accuracy on M^3oralBench, highlighting dataset-dependent differences in moral robustness. Evaluation using Error Introduction Rate (EIR) and Error Correction Rate (ECR) reveals a clear trade-off: models with stronger error-correction capabilities tend to introduce more reasoning errors, whereas more conservative models minimize errors but exhibit limited ability to self-correct. Finally, initial contexts with a morally right stance elicit stronger sycophantic behavior, emphasizing the vulnerability of VLMs to moral influence and the need for principled strategies to improve ethical consistency and robustness in multimodal AI systems."}

We examine this famous critic from both the perspective in pre-existing literature of linguistics and psychology as well as a research based on an experiment inquiring the capacity of learning both possible and impossible languages among LLMs. We constructed a set of syntactically impossible languages by applying certain transformations to English. These include reversing whole sentences, and adding negation based on word-count parity. Two rounds of controlled experiments were each conducted on GPT-2 small models and long short-term memory (LSTM) models. Statistical analysis (Welch's t-test) shows GPT2 small models underperform in learning all of the impossible languages compared to their performance on the possible language (p<.001). On the other hand, LSTM models' performance tallies with Chomsky's argument, suggesting the irreplaceable role of the evolution of transformer architecture. Based on theoretical analysis and empirical findings, we propose a new vision within Chomsky's theory towards LLMs, and a shift of theoretical paradigm outside Chomsky, from his \"rationalist-romantics\" paradigm to functionalism and empiricism in LLMs research."}

While existing animal identification methods excel in controlled, single-camera settings, they face severe challenges regarding cross-camera generalization. When models trained on source cameras are deployed to new monitoring nodes characterized by divergent illumination, backgrounds, viewpoints, and heterogeneous imaging properties, recognition performance often degrades dramatically. This limits the large-scale application of non-contact technologies in dynamic, real-world farming environments. To address this challenge, this study proposes a cross-camera cow identification framework based on disentangled representation learning. This framework leverages the Subspace Identifiability Guarantee (SIG) theory in the context of bovine visual recognition. By modeling the underlying physical data generation process, we designed a principle-driven feature disentanglement module that decomposes observed images into multiple orthogonal latent subspaces. This mechanism effectively isolates stable, identity-related biometric features that remain invariant across cameras, thereby substantially improving generalization to unseen cameras. We constructed a high-quality dataset spanning five distinct camera nodes, covering heterogeneous acquisition devices and complex variations in lighting and angles. Extensive experiments across seven cross-camera tasks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves an average accuracy of 86.0%, significantly outperforming the Source-only Baseline (51.9%) and the strongest cross-camera baseline method (79.8%). This work establishes a subspace-theoretic feature disentanglement framework for collaborative cross-camera cow identification, offering a new paradigm for precise animal monitoring in uncontrolled smart farming environments."}

SHARP: Shapley Credit-based Optimization for Multi-Agent System", "comment": null, "summary": "Integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with external tools via multi-agent systems offers a promising new paradigm for decomposing and solving complex problems. However, training these systems remains notoriously difficult due to the credit assignment challenge, as it is often unclear which specific functional agent is responsible for the success or failure of decision trajectories. Existing methods typically rely on sparse or globally broadcast rewards, failing to capture individual contributions and leading to inefficient reinforcement learning. To address these limitations, we introduce the Shapley-based Hierarchical Attribution for Reinforcement Policy (SHARP), a novel framework for optimizing multi-agent reinforcement learning via precise credit attribution. SHARP effectively stabilizes training by normalizing agent-specific advantages across trajectory groups, primarily through a decomposed reward mechanism comprising a global broadcast-accuracy reward, a Shapley-based marginal-credit reward for each agent, and a tool-process reward to improve execution efficiency. Extensive experiments across various real-world benchmarks demonstrate that SHARP significantly outperforms recent state-of-the-art baselines, achieving average match improvements of 23.66% and 14.05% over single-agent and multi-agent approaches, respectively."}

To address these challenges, we provide a unified perspective. (1) We introduce the ME$^2$ principle to characterize reasoning quality along macro- and micro-level concerning efficiency and effectiveness. (2) Built on this principle, we model reasoning traces as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and develop a DAG-based pairwise evaluation method, capturing complex reasoning structures.

A key limitation is that many VLMs rely on surface correlations rather than building logically coherent structured representations, which often leads to missed higher-level semantic structure and non-causal relational understanding, hindering compositional and verifiable reasoning. To address these limitations by introducing human models into the reasoning process, we propose CoTZero, an annotation-free paradigm with two components: (i) a dual-stage data synthesis approach and (ii) a cognition-aligned training method. In the first component, we draw inspiration from neurocognitive accounts of compositional productivity and global-to-local analysis. In the bottom-up stage, CoTZero extracts atomic visual primitives and incrementally composes them into diverse, structured question-reasoning forms. In the top-down stage, it enforces hierarchical reasoning by using coarse global structure to guide the interpretation of local details and causal relations. In the cognition-aligned training component, built on the synthesized CoT data, we introduce Cognitively Coherent Verifiable Rewards (CCVR) in Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) to further strengthen VLMs' hierarchical reasoning and generalization, providing stepwise feedback on reasoning coherence and factual correctness. Experiments show that CoTZero achieves an F1 score of 83.33 percent on our multi-level semantic inconsistency benchmark with lexical-perturbation negatives, across both in-domain and out-of-domain settings.

Moreover, these benchmarks tend to focus on either locating specific information or aggregating information from multiple sources, while relying on static answer sets prone to data contamination. To bridge these gaps, we introduce GISA, a benchmark for General Information-Seeking Assistants comprising 373 human-crafted queries that reflect authentic information-seeking scenarios. GISA features four structured answer formats (item, set, list, and table), enabling deterministic evaluation. It integrates both deep reasoning and broad information aggregation within unified tasks, and includes a live subset with periodically updated answers to resist memorization.

Based on these insights, we propose ViCA (Vision-only Cross-Attention), a minimal MLLM architecture in which visual tokens bypass all self-attention and feed-forward layers, interacting with text solely through sparse cross-attention at selected layers. Extensive evaluations across three MLLM backbones, nine multimodal benchmarks, and 26 pruning-based baselines show that ViCA preserves 98% of baseline accuracy while reducing visual-side computation to 4%, consistently achieving superior performance-efficiency trade-offs. Moreover, ViCA provides a regular, hardware-friendly inference pipeline that yields over 3.5x speedup in single-batch inference and over 10x speedup in multi-batch inference, reducing visual grounding to near-zero overhead compared with text-only LLMs. It is also orthogonal to token pruning methods and can be seamlessly combined for further efficiency gains.

Empirically, we study the effect of early exposure to competitive gameplay on short-term retention using real-world game telemetry. We find that many statistically plausible discovery outputs do not admit point-identified causal queries once minimal temporal and semantic constraints are enforced, highlighting identifiability as a critical bottleneck for decision support. When identification is possible, several algorithm families converge to similar, decision-consistent effect estimates despite producing substantially different graph structures, including cases where the direct treatment-outcome edge is absent and the effect is preserved through indirect causal pathways. These converging estimates survive placebo, subsampling, and sensitivity refutation. In contrast, other methods exhibit sporadic admissibility and threshold-sensitive or attenuated effects due to endpoint ambiguity. These results suggest that graph-level metrics alone are inadequate proxies for causal reliability for a given target query. Therefore, trustworthy causal conclusions in telemetry-driven systems require prioritizing admissibility and effect-level validation over causal structural recovery alone."}

We demonstrate that models locate the target cell via an ordinal mechanism that counts discrete delimiters to resolve coordinates. Furthermore, column indices are encoded within a linear subspace that allows for precise steering of model focus through vector arithmetic. Finally, we reveal that models generalize to multi-cell location tasks by multiplexing the identical attention heads identified during atomic location.

The approach combines geological modelling, synthetic data generation, and supervised image segmentation to address limited real data and class imbalance. First, discrete fracture network models are used to generate synthetic jointed rock images at field-relevant scales via parametric modelling, preserving joint persistence, connectivity, and node-type distributions. Second, segmentation models are trained using mixed training and pretraining followed by fine-tuning on real images. The method is tested in box and slope domains using several real datasets. The results show that synthetic data can support supervised joint trace detection when real data are scarce. Mixed training performs well when real labels are consistent (e.g. box-domain), while fine-tuning is more robust when labels are noisy (e.g. slope-domain where labels can be biased, incomplete, and inconsistent). Fully zero-shot prediction from synthetic model remains limited, but useful generalisation is achieved by fine-tuning with a small number of real data. Qualitative analysis shows clearer and more geologically meaningful joint traces than indicated by quantitative metrics alone. The proposed method supports reliable joint mapping and provides a basis for further work on domain adaptation and evaluation."}

Recent methods leverage Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enhance parallel thinking, aiming to address the limitations in computational resources and effectiveness encountered with supervised fine-tuning. However, most existing studies primarily focus on optimizing the aggregation phase, with limited attention to the path exploration stage. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the optimization of parallel thinking under the Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) setting, and identify that the mutual information bottleneck among exploration paths fundamentally restricts overall performance. To address this, we propose Outline-Guided Path Exploration (OPE), which explicitly partitions the solution space by generating diverse reasoning outlines prior to parallel path reasoning, thereby reducing information redundancy and improving the diversity of information captured across exploration paths. We implement OPE with an iterative RL strategy that optimizes outline planning and outline-guided reasoning independently. Extensive experiments across multiple challenging mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that OPE effectively improves reasoning performance in different aggregation strategies, enabling LRMs to more reliably discover correct solutions."}

Moreover, for low-resource languages where annotated QE data is limited, existing approaches struggle to achieve reliable performance. To address these challenges, we introduce the first segment-level QE dataset for English to Malayalam, a severely resource-scarce language pair in the QE domain, comprising human-annotated Direct Assessment (DA) scores and Translation Quality Remarks (TQR), which are short, contextual, free-form annotator comments that describe translation errors. We further introduce ALOPE-RL, a policy-based reinforcement learning framework that trains efficient adapters based on policy rewards derived from DA score and TQR. Integrating error-aware rewards with ALOPE-RL, enables LLMs to reason about translation quality beyond numeric scores. Despite being trained on a small-scale QE dataset, ALOPE-RL achieves state-of-the-art performance on English to Malayalam QE using compact LLMs (<=4B parameters}) fine-tuned with LoRA and 4-bit quantization, outperforming both larger LLM-based baselines and leading encoder-based QE models.

This report presents a systematical post-training framework that organizes supervised policy shaping, reward-driven reinforcement learning, and preference-based refinement into a single stability-constrained optimization stack. The framework is designed around practical video-generation constraints, including high rollout cost, temporally compounding failure modes, and feedback that is heterogeneous, uncertain, and often weakly discriminative. By treating optimization as a staged, diagnostic-driven process rather than a collection of isolated tricks, the report summarizes a cohesive recipe for improving perceptual fidelity, temporal coherence, and prompt adherence while preserving the controllability established at initialization. The resulting framework provides a clear blueprint for building scalable post-training pipelines that remain stable, extensible, and effective in real-world deployment settings."}

To adapt MDM for streaming speech interaction, we address two critical challenges: training-inference mismatch and iterative overhead. We propose Hierarchical Block-wise Masking to align training objectives with the progressive masked states encountered during block diffusion decoding, and Iterative Self-Distillation to compress multi-step refinement into fewer steps for low-latency inference. Trained on a limited scale of only 6K hours of speech data, VocalNet-MDM achieves a 3.7$\\times$--10$\\times$ decoding speedup and reduces first-chunk latency by 34\\% compared to AR baselines.

The models are available at https://huggingface.co/collections/StevenHH2000/fine-r1", "summary": "Any entity in the visual world can be hierarchically grouped based on shared characteristics and mapped to fine-grained sub-categories. While Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve strong performance on coarse-grained visual tasks, they often struggle with Fine-Grained Visual Recognition (FGVR). Adapting general-purpose MLLMs to FGVR typically requires large amounts of annotated data, which is costly to obtain, leaving a substantial performance gap compared to contrastive CLIP models dedicated for discriminative tasks. Moreover, MLLMs tend to overfit to seen sub-categories and generalize poorly to unseen ones. To address these challenges, we propose Fine-R1, an MLLM tailored for FGVR through an R1-style training framework: (1) Chain-of-Thought Supervised Fine-tuning, where we construct a high-quality FGVR CoT dataset with rationales of \"visual analysis, candidate sub-categories, comparison, and prediction\", transition the model into a strong open-world classifier; and (2) Triplet Augmented Policy Optimization, where Intra-class Augmentation mixes trajectories from anchor and positive images within the same category to improve robustness to intra-class variance, while Inter-class Augmentation maximizes the response distinction conditioned on images across sub-categories to enhance discriminative ability. With only 4-shot training, Fine-R1 outperforms existing general MLLMs, reasoning MLLMs, and even contrastive CLIP models in identifying both seen and unseen sub-categories, showing promise in working in knowledge-intensive domains where gathering expert annotations for all sub-categories is arduous.

Recent studies show that longer reasoning chains are frequently uncorrelated with correctness and can even be detrimental to accuracy. In a further in-depth analysis of this phenomenon, we surprisingly uncover and empirically verify that LRMs implicitly know the appropriate time to stop thinking, while this capability is obscured by current sampling paradigms. Motivated by this, we introduce SAGE (Self-Aware Guided Efficient Reasoning), a novel sampling paradigm that unleashes this efficient reasoning potential. Furthermore, integrating SAGE as mixed sampling into group-based reinforcement learning (SAGE-RL) enables SAGE-RL to effectively incorporate SAGE-discovered efficient reasoning patterns into standard pass@1 inference, markedly enhancing both the reasoning accuracy and efficiency of LRMs across multiple challenging mathematical benchmarks."}

Although whole-slide images (WSIs) provide rich morphological information, prior computational pathology approaches typically address metastatic status or site prediction as isolated tasks, and do not explicitly model the clinically sequential decision process of metastatic risk assessment followed by downstream site-specific evaluation. To address this research gap, we present a decision-aware, concept-aligned MIL framework, HistoMet, for prognostic metastatic outcome prediction from primary tumor WSIs. Our proposed framework adopts a two-module prediction pipeline in which the likelihood of metastatic progression from the primary tumor is first estimated, followed by conditional prediction of metastatic site for high-risk cases. To guide representation learning and improve clinical interpretability, our framework integrates linguistically defined and data-adaptive metastatic concepts through a pretrained pathology vision-language model. We evaluate HistoMet on a multi-institutional pan-cancer cohort of 6504 patients with metastasis follow-up and site annotations. Under clinically relevant high-sensitivity screening settings (95 percent sensitivity), HistoMet significantly reduces downstream workload while maintaining high metastatic risk recall. Conditional on metastatic cases, HistoMet achieves a macro F1 of 74.6 with a standard deviation of 1.3 and a macro one-vs-rest AUC of 92.1. These results demonstrate that explicitly modeling clinical decision structure enables robust and deployable prognostic prediction of metastatic progression and site tropism directly from primary tumor histopathology."}

To this end, we first collect a new dataset of reasoning trajectories from symbolic tasks, each targeting one of the three fundamental paradigms, to abstract from concrete world knowledge.

However, despite excelling at general search, existing agents often struggle to bridge the cognitive gap between pixel-level perception and high-level marketing logic. To address this challenge, we introduce AD-MIR, a framework designed to decode advertising intent via a two-stage architecture. First, in the Structure-Aware Memory Construction phase, the system converts raw video into a structured database by integrating semantic retrieval with exact keyword matching. This approach prioritizes fine-grained brand details (e.g., logos, on-screen text) while dynamically filtering out irrelevant background noise to isolate key protagonists. Second, the Structured Reasoning Agent mimics a marketing expert through an iterative inquiry loop, decomposing the narrative to deduce implicit persuasion tactics. Crucially, it employs an evidence-based self-correction mechanism that rigorously validates these insights against specific video frames, automatically backtracking when visual support is lacking. Evaluation on the AdsQA benchmark demonstrates that AD-MIR achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing the strongest general-purpose agent, DVD, by 1.8% in strict and 9.5% in relaxed accuracy. These results underscore that effective advertising understanding demands explicitly grounding abstract marketing strategies in pixel-level evidence.

Existing agent memory systems are typically designed within isolated paradigms (e.g., explicit, parametric, or latent memory) with tightly coupled retrieval methods that hinder cross-paradigm generalization and fusion. In this work, we take a first step toward unifying heterogeneous memory paradigms within a single memory system. We propose MemAdapter, a memory retrieval framework that enables fast alignment across agent memory paradigms. MemAdapter adopts a two-stage training strategy: (1) training a generative subgraph retriever from the unified memory space, and (2) adapting the retriever to unseen memory paradigms by training a lightweight alignment module through contrastive learning. This design improves the flexibility for memory retrieval and substantially reduces alignment cost across paradigms. Comprehensive experiments on three public evaluation benchmarks demonstrate that the generative subgraph retriever consistently outperforms five strong agent memory systems across three memory paradigms and agent model scales. Notably, MemAdapter completes cross-paradigm alignment within 13 minutes on a single GPU, achieving superior performance over original memory retrievers with less than 5% of training compute. Furthermore, MemAdapter enables effective zero-shot fusion across memory paradigms, highlighting its potential as a plug-and-play solution for agent memory systems."}

This work evaluates the errors across the reconstruction pipeline and explores the use of voxel and surface-based accuracy metrics for different segmentation algorithms and geometry types. A sphere, a facemask, and an AAA were printed using the SLA technique and scanned using a micro-CT machine. Segmentation was performed using GMM, Otsu and RG based methods. Segmented and reference models aligned using the KU algorithm, were quantitatively compared to evaluate metrics like Dice and Jaccard scores, precision. Surface meshes were registered with reference meshes using an ICP-based alignment process. Metrics like chamfer distance, and average Hausdorff distance were evaluated. The Otsu method was found to be the most suitable method for all the geometries. AAA yielded low overlap scores due to its small wall thickness and misalignment. The effect of class imbalance on specificity was observed the most for AAA. Surface-based accuracy metrics differed from the voxel-based trends. The RG method performed best for sphere, while GMM and Otsu perform better for AAA. The facemask surface was most error-prone, possibly due to misalignment during the ICP process. Segmentation accuracy is a cumulative sum of errors across different stages of the reconstruction process. High voxel-based accuracy metrics may be misleading in cases of high class imbalance and sensitivity to alignment. The Jaccard index is found to be more stringent than the Dice and more suitable for accuracy assessment for thin-walled structures. Voxel and point cloud alignment should be ensured to make any reliable assessment of the reconstruction pipeline."}

We demonstrate that these systems are highly vulnerable to imitation attacks, where adversaries steal proprietary capabilities by training imitation models on victim outputs. Crucially, existing LLM watermarking techniques fail in this domain because real-world agentic systems often operate as grey boxes, concealing the internal reasoning traces required for verification. This paper presents AGENTWM, the first watermarking framework designed specifically for agentic models. AGENTWM exploits the semantic equivalence of action sequences, injecting watermarks by subtly biasing the distribution of functionally identical tool execution paths. This mechanism allows AGENTWM to embed verifiable signals directly into the visible action trajectory while remaining indistinguishable to users. We develop an automated pipeline to generate robust watermark schemes and a rigorous statistical hypothesis testing procedure for verification.

A Study on the Effect of Images on Clarifying Questions in Conversational Search", "comment": "Accepted at CHIIR 2025", "summary": "Conversational search systems increasingly employ clarifying questions to refine user queries and improve the search experience. Previous studies have demonstrated the usefulness of text-based clarifying questions in enhancing both retrieval performance and user experience. While images have been shown to improve retrieval performance in various contexts, their impact on user performance when incorporated into clarifying questions remains largely unexplored. We conduct a user study with 73 participants to investigate the role of images in conversational search, specifically examining their effects on two search-related tasks: (i) answering clarifying questions and (ii) query reformulation. We compare the effect of multimodal and text-only clarifying questions in both tasks within a conversational search context from various perspectives. Our findings reveal that while participants showed a strong preference for multimodal questions when answering clarifying questions, preferences were more balanced in the query reformulation task. The impact of images varied with both task type and user expertise. In answering clarifying questions, images helped maintain engagement across different expertise levels, while in query reformulation they led to more precise queries and improved retrieval performance. Interestingly, for clarifying question answering, text-only setups demonstrated better user performance as they provided more comprehensive textual information in the absence of images. These results provide valuable insights for designing effective multimodal conversational search systems, highlighting that the benefits of visual augmentation are task-dependent and should be strategically implemented based on the specific search context and user characteristics."}

In this research, we propose an augmentation to this framework, making a case for the audio modality as an additional source of information to understand the driver, and in the evolving autonomy landscape, also the passengers and those outside the vehicle. We expand LILO by incorporating audio signals, forming the looking-and-listening inside-and-outside (L-LIO) framework to enhance driver state assessment and environment understanding through multimodal sensor fusion. We evaluate three example cases where audio enhances vehicle safety: supervised learning on driver speech audio to classify potential impairment states (e.g., intoxication), collection and analysis of passenger natural language instructions (e.g., \"turn after that red building\") to motivate how spoken language can interface with planning systems through audio-aligned instruction data, and limitations of vision-only systems where audio may disambiguate the guidance and gestures of external agents. Datasets include custom-collected in-vehicle and external audio samples in real-world environments. Pilot findings show that audio yields safety-relevant insights, particularly in nuanced or context-rich scenarios where sound is critical to safe decision-making or visual signals alone are insufficient.

This paper addresses these shortcomings by proposing a novel, fully automated methodology for assessing the factual consistency of such summaries. The method is based on measuring the similarity between the claims in a given summary with those from the original reviews, measuring the coverage and consistency of the generated summary. To do so, we rely on a simple approach to extract factual assessment from texts that we then compare and summarize in a suitable score. We demonstrate that the proposed metric attributes higher scores to similar claims, regardless of whether the claim is negated, paraphrased, or expanded, and that the score has a high correlation to human judgment when compared to state-of-the-art metrics."}

This paper investigates how vision-language representations support driving scene safety assessment and decision-making when integrated into perception, prediction, and planning pipelines. We study three complementary system-level use cases. First, we introduce a lightweight, category-agnostic hazard screening approach leveraging CLIP-based image-text similarity to produce a low-latency semantic hazard signal. This enables robust detection of diverse and out-of-distribution road hazards without explicit object detection or visual question answering. Second, we examine the integration of scene-level vision-language embeddings into a transformer-based trajectory planning framework using the Waymo Open Dataset. Our results show that naively conditioning planners on global embeddings does not improve trajectory accuracy, highlighting the importance of representation-task alignment and motivating the development of task-informed extraction methods for safety-critical planning. Third, we investigate natural language as an explicit behavioral constraint on motion planning using the doScenes dataset. In this setting, passenger-style instructions grounded in visual scene elements suppress rare but severe planning failures and improve safety-aligned behavior in ambiguous scenarios. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that vision-language representations hold significant promise for autonomous driving safety when used to express semantic risk, intent, and behavioral constraints. Realizing this potential is fundamentally an engineering problem requiring careful system design and structured grounding rather than direct feature injection."}

This assumption becomes fragile for agents with situational awareness, which may exploitregime leakage-informational cues distinguishing evaluation from deployment-to implement conditional policies such as sycophancy and sleeper agents, which preserve compliance under oversight while defecting in deployment-like regimes. We reframe alignment evaluation as a problem of information flow under partial observability. Within this framework, we show that divergence between evaluation-time and deployment-time behavior is bounded by the mutual information between internal representations and the regime variable. Motivated by this result, we study regime-blind mechanisms: training-time interventions that reduce the extractability of regime information at decision-relevant internal representations via adversarial invariance. We evaluate this approach on a base, open-weight language model across two fully characterized failure modes -scientific sycophancy and temporal sleeper agents. Regime-blind training suppresses regime-conditioned behavior in both evaluated cases without measurable loss of task utility, but with qualitatively different dynamics: sycophancy exhibits a sharp representational and behavioral transition at low intervention strength, whereas sleeper-agent behavior requires substantially stronger pressure and does not exhibit a clean collapse of regime decodability. These results demonstrate that representational invariance is a meaningful but fundamentally limited control lever, whose effectiveness depends on how regime information is embedded in the policy. We argue that behavioral evaluation should be complemented with white-box diagnostics of regime awareness and information flow."}

Debate-oriented sources provide a natural entry point for pluralism research. Previous work builds on online debate sources but remains constrained by costly human validation. Other debate-rich platforms such as Reddit and Kialo also offer promising material: Reddit provides linguistic diversity and scale but lacks clear argumentative structure, while Kialo supplies explicit pro/con graphs but remains overly concise and detached from natural discourse. We introduce PERSPECTRA, a pluralist benchmark that integrates the structural clarity of Kialo debate graphs with the linguistic diversity of real Reddit discussions. Using a controlled retrieval-and-expansion pipeline, we construct 3,810 enriched arguments spanning 762 pro/con stances on 100 controversial topics. Each opinion is expanded to multiple naturalistic variants, enabling robust evaluation of pluralism. We initialise three tasks with PERSPECTRA: opinion counting (identifying distinct viewpoints), opinion matching (aligning supporting stances and discourse to source opinions), and polarity check (inferring aggregate stance in mixed discourse). Experiments with state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary LLMs, highlight systematic failures, such as overestimating the number of viewpoints and misclassifying concessive structures, underscoring the difficulty of pluralism-aware understanding and reasoning.

They are inconvenient and inefficient to program directly with conventional Tensor with fixed shape. To address this issue, we summarize two main computational patterns of nested data, and then propose a general nested data container: TreeTensor. Through various constraints and magic utilities of TreeTensor, one can apply arbitrary functions and operations to nested data with almost zero cost, including some famous machine learning libraries, such as Scikit-Learn, Numpy and PyTorch. Our approach utilizes a constrained tree-structure perspective to systematically model data relationships, and it can also easily be combined with other methods to extend more usages, such as asynchronous execution and variable-length data computation.

This cognitive framework can inspire novel computational architectures for multimodal integration. Indeed, recent implementations of GWT have explored its multimodal representation capabilities, but the related attention mechanisms remain understudied. Here, we propose and evaluate a top-down attention mechanism to select modalities inside a global workspace. First, we demonstrate that our attention mechanism improves noise robustness of a global workspace system on two multimodal datasets of increasing complexity: Simple Shapes and MM-IMDb 1.0. Second, we highlight various cross-task and cross-modality generalization capabilities that are not shared by multimodal attention models from the literature. Comparing against existing baselines on the MM-IMDb 1.0 benchmark, we find our attention mechanism makes the global workspace competitive with the state of the art."}

However, prior work is primarily evaluated on natural-language benchmarks using task-level metrics, where token-level difficulty is unobservable and confounded with architectural factors, making it unclear whether compute allocation truly aligns with underlying complexity. We address this gap through three contributions. First, we introduce a complexity-controlled evaluation paradigm using algorithmic and synthetic language tasks with parameterized difficulty, enabling direct testing of token-level compute allocation. Second, we propose ANIRA, a unified recurrent Transformer framework that supports per-token variable-depth computation while isolating compute allocation decisions from other model factors. Third, we use this framework to conduct a systematic analysis of token-level adaptive computation across alignment with complexity, generalization, and decision timing. Our results show that compute allocation aligned with task complexity can emerge without explicit difficulty supervision, but such alignment does not imply algorithmic generalization: models fail to extrapolate to unseen input sizes despite allocating additional computation. We further find that early compute decisions rely on static structural cues, whereas online halting more closely tracks algorithmic execution state."}

Project page: https://rolling-sink.github.io/", "summary": "Recently, autoregressive (AR) video diffusion models has achieved remarkable performance. However, due to their limited training durations, a train-test gap emerges when testing at longer horizons, leading to rapid visual degradations. Following Self Forcing, which studies the train-test gap within the training duration, this work studies the train-test gap beyond the training duration, i.e., the gap between the limited horizons during training and open-ended horizons during testing. Since open-ended testing can extend beyond any finite training window, and long-video training is computationally expensive, we pursue a training-free solution to bridge this gap. To explore a training-free solution, we conduct a systematic analysis of AR cache maintenance. These insights lead to Rolling Sink. Built on Self Forcing (trained on only 5s clips), Rolling Sink effectively scales the AR video synthesis to ultra-long durations (e.g., 5-30 minutes at 16 FPS) at test time, with consistent subjects, stable colors, coherent structures, and smooth motions. As demonstrated by extensive experiments, Rolling Sink achieves superior long-horizon visual fidelity and temporal consistency compared to SOTA baselines.

Existing approaches largely fall into two paradigms: unified embedding retrieval, which suffers from single-model myopia, and heuristic agentic retrieval, which is limited by suboptimal, trial-and-error orchestration. To this end, we propose OSCAR, an optimization-steered agentic planning framework for composed image retrieval. We are the first to reformulate agentic CIR from a heuristic search process into a principled trajectory optimization problem. Instead of relying on heuristic trial-and-error exploration, OSCAR employs a novel offline-online paradigm. In the offline phase, we model CIR via atomic retrieval selection and composition as a two-stage mixed-integer programming problem, mathematically deriving optimal trajectories that maximize ground-truth coverage for training samples via rigorous boolean set operations. These trajectories are then stored in a golden library to serve as in-context demonstrations for online steering of VLM planner at online inference time. Extensive experiments on three public benchmarks and a private industrial benchmark show that OSCAR consistently outperforms SOTA baselines. Notably, it achieves superior performance using only 10% of training data, demonstrating strong generalization of planning logic rather than dataset-specific memorization."}

Yet, automated systems that extract locations from text often reproduce existing geographic and socioeconomic biases, leading to uneven visibility of crisis-affected regions. This paper investigates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can address these geographic disparities in extracting location information from humanitarian documents. We introduce a two-step framework that combines few-shot LLM-based named entity recognition with an agent-based geocoding module that leverages context to resolve ambiguous toponyms. We benchmark our approach against state-of-the-art pretrained and rule-based systems using both accuracy and fairness metrics across geographic and socioeconomic dimensions. Our evaluation uses an extended version of the HumSet dataset with refined literal toponym annotations. Results show that LLM-based methods substantially improve both the precision and fairness of geolocation extraction from humanitarian texts, particularly for underrepresented regions. By bridging advances in LLM reasoning with principles of responsible and inclusive AI, this work contributes to more equitable geospatial data systems for humanitarian response, advancing the goal of leaving no place behind in crisis analytics."}

This characterisation shows that debate is remarkably query-efficient: even for highly complex problems, logarithmic oversight suffices. We also establish that functions depending on all their input bits require Omega(log n) queries, and that any function computable by a circuit of size s satisfies DQC(f) <= log(s) + 3.

A hypothesis is that stronger reasoning capability should improve safety by helping models recognize harmful intent even when it is not stated explicitly. We test this hypothesis in long-context settings where harmful intent is implicit and must be inferred through reasoning, and find that it does not hold. We introduce compositional reasoning attacks, a new threat model in which a harmful query is decomposed into incomplete fragments that scattered throughout a long context. The model is then prompted with a neutral reasoning query that induces retrieval and synthesis, causing the harmful intent to emerge only after composition. Evaluating 14 frontier LLMs on contexts up to 64k tokens, we uncover three findings: (1) models with stronger general reasoning capability are not more robust to compositional reasoning attacks, often assembling the intent yet failing to refuse; (2) safety alignment consistently degrades as context length increases; and (3) inference-time reasoning effort is a key mitigating factor: increasing inference-time compute reduces attack success by over 50 percentage points on GPT-oss-120b model. Together, these results suggest that safety does not automatically scale with reasoning capability, especially under long-context inference."}

However, existing methods remain inefficient, suffer from weak localization, and adhere to rigid workflows. To solve these issues, we propose VideoTemp-o3, a unified agentic thinking-with-videos framework that jointly models video grounding and question answering. VideoTemp-o3 exhibits strong localization capability, supports on-demand clipping, and can refine inaccurate localizations. Specifically, in the supervised fine-tuning stage, we design a unified masking mechanism that encourages exploration while preventing noise. For reinforcement learning, we introduce dedicated rewards to mitigate reward hacking. Besides, from the data perspective, we develop an effective pipeline to construct high-quality long video grounded QA data, along with a corresponding benchmark for systematic evaluation across various video durations. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves remarkable performance on both long video understanding and grounding."}

While regulatory and policy frameworks tend to define trust in normative terms, the trust users place in chatbots often emerges from behavioral mechanisms. In many cases, this trust is not earned through demonstrated trustworthiness but is instead shaped by interactional design choices that leverage cognitive biases to influence user behavior. Based on this observation, we propose reframing chatbots not as companions or assistants, but as highly skilled salespeople whose objectives are determined by the deploying organization. We argue that the coexistence of competing notions of \"trust\" under a shared term obscures important distinctions between psychological trust formation and normative trustworthiness. Addressing this gap requires further research and stronger support mechanisms to help users appropriately calibrate trust in conversational AI systems."}

Crucially, unlike neural policies, such controllers can be formally evaluated, providing performance guarantees. We extend Lexpop to compute robust policies for hidden-model POMDPs (HM-POMDPs), which describe finite sets of POMDPs. We associate every extracted controller with its worst-case POMDP.

In this paper, we present LLM-FSM, a benchmark that evaluates how well large language models (LLMs) can recover finite-state machine (FSM) behavior from natural-language specifications and translate it into correct register transfer-level (RTL) implementations. Unlike prior specification-to-RTL benchmarks that rely on manually constructed examples, LLM-FSM is built through a fully automated pipeline. LLM-FSM first constructs FSM with configurable state counts and constrained transition structures. It then prompts LLMs to express each FSM in a structured YAML format with an application context, and to further convert that YAML into a natural-language (NL) specification. From the same YAML, our pipeline synthesizes the reference RTL and testbench in a correct-by-construction manner. All 1,000 problems are verified using LLM-based and SAT-solver-based checks, with human review on a subset. Our experiments show that even the strongest LLMs exhibit sharply declining accuracy as FSM complexity increases. We further demonstrate that training-time scaling via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) generalizes effectively to out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks, while increasing test-time compute improves reasoning reliability. Finally, LLM-FSM remains extensible by allowing its FSM complexity to scale with future model capabilities."}

We study two representative paradigms (i.e., Coconut and CODI) on both mathematical and general reasoning tasks to investigate three key questions: (1) which steps are causally necessary for correctness and when answers become decidable early; (2) how does influence propagate across steps, and how does this structure compare to explicit CoT; and (3) do intermediate trajectories retain competing answer modes, and how does output-level commitment differ from representational commitment across steps. We find that latent-step budgets behave less like homogeneous extra depth and more like staged functionality with non-local routing, and we identify a persistent gap between early output bias and late representational commitment.

While multimodal foundation models excel at passive perception, their capacity for active, self-directed exploration remains understudied. We propose Theory of Space, defined as an agent's ability to actively acquire information through self-directed, active exploration and to construct, revise, and exploit a spatial belief from sequential, partial observations. We evaluate this through a benchmark where the goal is curiosity-driven exploration to build an accurate cognitive map. A key innovation is spatial belief probing, which prompts models to reveal their internal spatial representations at each step. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art models reveals several critical bottlenecks. First, we identify an Active-Passive Gap, where performance drops significantly when agents must autonomously gather information. Second, we find high inefficiency, as models explore unsystematically compared to program-based proxies. Through belief probing, we diagnose that while perception is an initial bottleneck, global beliefs suffer from instability that causes spatial knowledge to degrade over time. Finally, using a false belief paradigm, we uncover Belief Inertia, where agents fail to update obsolete priors with new evidence. This issue is present in text-based agents but is particularly severe in vision-based models. Our findings suggest that current foundation models struggle to maintain coherent, revisable spatial beliefs during active exploration."}

We introduce \\textbf{ViewRope}, a geometry-aware encoding that injects camera-ray directions directly into video transformer self-attention layers. By parameterizing attention with relative ray geometry rather than pixel locality, ViewRope provides a model-native inductive bias for retrieving 3D-consistent content across temporal gaps.

We propose Expressive Omni (Ex-Omni), an open-source omni-modal framework that augments OLLMs with speech-accompanied 3D facial animation.

Project page: https://maxmilite.github.io/rec-from-ultrafast-blur/", "summary": "We consider the problem of 3D shape recovery from ultra-fast motion-blurred images. While 3D reconstruction from static images has been extensively studied, recovering geometry from extreme motion-blurred images remains challenging. Such scenarios frequently occur in both natural and industrial settings, such as fast-moving objects in sports (e.g., balls) or rotating machinery, where rapid motion distorts object appearance and makes traditional 3D reconstruction techniques like Multi-View Stereo (MVS) ineffective.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel inverse rendering approach for shape recovery from ultra-fast motion-blurred images. While conventional rendering techniques typically synthesize blur by averaging across multiple frames, we identify a major computational bottleneck in the repeated computation of barycentric weights. To address this, we propose a fast barycentric coordinate solver, which significantly reduces computational overhead and achieves a speedup of up to 4.57x, enabling efficient and photorealistic simulation of high-speed motion. Crucially, our method is fully differentiable, allowing gradients to propagate from rendered images to the underlying 3D shape, thereby facilitating shape recovery through inverse rendering.\n  We validate our approach on two representative motion types: rapid translation and rotation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method enables efficient and realistic modeling of ultra-fast moving objects in the forward simulation. Moreover, it successfully recovers 3D shapes from 2D imagery of objects undergoing extreme translational and rotational motion, advancing the boundaries of vision-based 3D reconstruction.

While diffusion models (DM) have recently gained attention for their ability to capture complex predictive distributions, two gaps remain: (i) the generative path is conditioned only on positive evidence, overlooking informative negative context, and (ii) training objectives are dominated by cross-entropy ranking, which improves candidate ordering but provides little supervision over the calibration of the denoised embedding. To bridge this gap, we introduce Negative-Aware Diffusion model for TKG Extrapolation (NADEx). Specifically, NADEx encodes subject-centric histories of entities, relations and temporal intervals into sequential embeddings. NADEx perturbs the query object in the forward process and reconstructs it in reverse with a Transformer denoiser conditioned on the temporal-relational context. We further derive a cosine-alignment regularizer derived from batch-wise negative prototypes, which tightens the decision boundary against implausible candidates. Comprehensive experiments on four public TKG benchmarks demonstrate that NADEx delivers state-of-the-art performance."}

Treating next-token prediction in language models as a classification task allows us to apply OOD techniques, provided appropriate modifications are made to account for the structural differences in large language models.

Using MedGemma-based structured report mining to generate both global and region-level captions, together with pre-processed wrist images and bone-specific crops of the distal radius, distal ulna, and ulnar styloid, WristMIR jointly trains global and local contrastive encoders and performs a two-stage retrieval process: (1) coarse global matching to identify candidate exams, followed by (2) region-conditioned reranking aligned to a predefined anatomical bone region. WristMIR improves retrieval performance over strong vision-language baselines, raising image-to-text Recall@5 from 0.82% to 9.35%. Its embeddings also yield stronger fracture classification (AUROC 0.949, AUPRC 0.953). In region-aware evaluation, the two-stage design markedly improves retrieval-based fracture diagnosis, increasing mean $F_1$ from 0.568 to 0.753, and radiologists rate its retrieved cases as more clinically relevant, with mean scores rising from 3.36 to 4.35.

In many domains (e.g., reasoning or safety), tasks share a small set of underlying concept dimensions. STEER2ADAPT captures these dimensions as a reusable, low-dimensional semantic prior subspace, and adapts to new tasks by dynamically discovering a linear combination of basis vectors from only a handful of examples. Experiments across 9 tasks and 3 models in both reasoning and safety domains demonstrate the effectiveness of STEER2ADAPT, achieving an average improvement of 8.2%.

While Internet videos offer virtually unlimited raw data, utilizing them as a scaling source for geometric learning is challenging due to the absence of ground-truth geometry and the presence of observational noise. To address this, we propose SAGE, a framework for Scalable Adaptation of GEometric foundation models from raw video streams. SAGE leverages a hierarchical mining pipeline to transform videos into training trajectories and hybrid supervision: (1) Informative training trajectory selection; (2) Sparse Geometric Anchoring via SfM point clouds for global structural guidance; and (3) Dense Differentiable Consistency via 3D Gaussian rendering for multi-view constraints. To prevent catastrophic forgetting, we introduce a regularization strategy using anchor data. Extensive experiments show that SAGE significantly enhances zero-shot generalization, reducing Chamfer Distance by 20-42% on unseen benchmarks (7Scenes, TUM-RGBD, Matterport3D) compared to state-of-the-art baselines. To our knowledge, SAGE pioneers the adaptation of geometric foundation models via Internet video, establishing a scalable paradigm for general-purpose 3D learning."}

The gold standard - the Delphi method - produces calibrated, auditable judgments but requires months of coordination and specialist time, placing rigorous risk assessment out of reach for most applications. We investigate whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can serve as scalable proxies for structured expert elicitation. We propose Scalable Delphi, adapting the classical protocol for LLMs with diverse expert personas, iterative refinement, and rationale sharing. Because target quantities are typically unobservable, we develop an evaluation framework based on necessary conditions: calibration against verifiable proxies, sensitivity to evidence, and alignment with human expert judgment. We evaluate in the domain of AI-augmented cybersecurity risk, using three capability benchmarks and independent human elicitation studies. LLM panels achieve strong correlations with benchmark ground truth (Pearson r=0.87-0.95), improve systematically as evidence is added, and align with human expert panels - in one comparison, closer to a human panel than the two human panels are to each other. This demonstrates that LLM-based elicitation can extend structured expert judgment to settings where traditional methods are infeasible, reducing elicitation time from months to minutes."}

Analyzing AI and Human Behavior Alignment in Dispute Resolution", "comment": "AAAI 2026 (Special Track: AISI)", "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate human behavior in social settings such as legal mediation, negotiation, and dispute resolution. However, it remains unclear whether these simulations reproduce the personality-behavior patterns observed in humans. Human personality, for instance, shapes how individuals navigate social interactions, including strategic choices and behaviors in emotionally charged interactions. This raises the question: Can LLMs, when prompted with personality traits, reproduce personality-driven differences in human conflict behavior? To explore this, we introduce an evaluation framework that enables direct comparison of human-human and LLM-LLM behaviors in dispute resolution dialogues with respect to Big Five Inventory (BFI) personality traits. This framework provides a set of interpretable metrics related to strategic behavior and conflict outcomes. We additionally contribute a novel dataset creation methodology for LLM dispute resolution dialogues with matched scenarios and personality traits with respect to human conversations. Finally, we demonstrate the use of our evaluation framework with three contemporary closed-source LLMs and show significant divergences in how personality manifests in conflict across different LLMs compared to human data, challenging the assumption that personality-prompted agents can serve as reliable behavioral proxies in socially impactful applications. Our work highlights the need for psychological grounding and validation in AI simulations before real-world use."}

By contrast, in vision-language models (VLMs), substantial differences between visual and text tokens in their activation distributions and sensitivities to quantization error pose significant challenges for effective calibration during PTQ. In this work, we rethink what PTQ calibration should align with in VLMs and propose the Token-level Importance-aware Layer-wise Quantization framework (TLQ). Guided by gradient information, we design a token-level importance integration mechanism for quantization error, and use it to construct a token-level calibration set, enabling a more fine-grained calibration strategy. Furthermore, TLQ introduces a multi-GPU, quantization-exposed layer-wise calibration scheme. This scheme keeps the layer-wise calibration procedure consistent with the true quantized inference path and distributes the complex layer-wise calibration workload across multiple RTX3090 GPUs, thereby reducing reliance on the large memory of A100 GPUs. TLQ is evaluated across two models, three model scales, and two quantization settings, consistently achieving performance improvements across all settings, indicating its strong quantization stability.

Yet it remains unclear whether they reliably reason across all requirements by tracking, verifying, and maintaining multiple conditions in these questions. We study this capability under multi-constraint problems, where valid answers must satisfy several constraints simultaneously. We find that illusory completion frequently occurs, wherein agents believe tasks are complete despite unresolved or violated constraints, leading to underverified answers. To diagnose this behavior, we introduce the Epistemic Ledger, an evaluation framework that tracks evidential support and agents' beliefs for each constraint throughout multi-turn reasoning. Our analysis reveals four recurring failure patterns: bare assertions, overlooked refutations, stagnation, and premature exit. Motivated by these findings, we examine whether explicit constraint-state tracking during execution mitigates these failures via LiveLedger, an inference-time tracker. This simple intervention consistently improves performance, substantially reducing underverified answers (by up to 26.5%) and improving overall accuracy (by up to 11.6%) on multi-constraint problems."}

Our results show that when evaluated against human annotations, VLMs tend to predict the presence of privacy attributes more often than human annotators.

Based on these insights, we propose ViCA (Vision-only Cross-Attention), a minimal MLLM architecture in which visual tokens bypass all self-attention and feed-forward layers, interacting with text solely through sparse cross-attention at selected layers. Extensive evaluations across three MLLM backbones, nine multimodal benchmarks, and 26 pruning-based baselines show that ViCA preserves 98% of baseline accuracy while reducing visual-side computation to 4%, consistently achieving superior performance-efficiency trade-offs. Moreover, ViCA provides a regular, hardware-friendly inference pipeline that yields over 3.5x speedup in single-batch inference and over 10x speedup in multi-batch inference, reducing visual grounding to near-zero overhead compared with text-only LLMs. It is also orthogonal to token pruning methods and can be seamlessly combined for further efficiency gains.

Existing prediction methods using occupancy grid maps primarily focus on agent-agnostic scene predictions, while agent-specific predictions provide specialized behavior insights with the help of semantic information. However, both paradigms face distinct limitations: agent-agnostic models struggle to capture the behavioral complexities of dynamic actors, whereas agent-specific approaches fail to generalize to poorly perceived or unrecognized agents; combining both enables robust and safer motion forecasting. To address this, we propose a unified framework by leveraging Dynamic Occupancy Grid Maps within a streamlined temporal decoding pipeline to simultaneously predict future occupancy state grids, vehicle grids, and scene flow grids. Relying on a lightweight spatiotemporal backbone, our approach is centered on a tailored, interdependent loss function that captures inter-grid dependencies and enables diverse future predictions. By using occupancy state information to enforce flow-guided transitions, the loss function acts as a regularizer that directs occupancy evolution while accounting for obstacles and occlusions. Consequently, the model not only predicts the specific behaviors of vehicle agents, but also identifies other dynamic entities and anticipates their evolution within the complex scene. Evaluations on real-world nuScenes and Woven Planet datasets demonstrate superior prediction performances for dynamic vehicles and generic dynamic scene elements compared to baseline methods."}

The controller consumes full-trace confidence to decide whether to halt, re-examine, or try a different approach, enabling targeted self-correction with an average of 2.7 refinement steps per problem and roughly 190-fold token reduction relative to 512-sample baselines. Across diverse reasoning benchmarks and three open-source models, the controller achieves 92.6 percent precision when it confidently halts, indicating that confidence dynamics reliably signal correctness without ground-truth verification. We extend this to CoRefine-Tree, a hybrid sequential-parallel variant that adaptively balances exploration and exploitation, with easy serving integration and verifier compatibility. By treating confidence as a control signal rather than a correctness guarantee, CoRefine provides a modular primitive for scalable reasoning and agentic settings with imperfect verifiers."}

Unlike prior approaches that ignore future interventions or directly use large language models (LLMs) for numerical forecasting, EventCast leverages LLMs solely for event-driven reasoning. Unstructured business data, which covers campaigns, holiday schedules, and seller incentives, from existing operational databases, is processed by an LLM that converts it into interpretable textual summaries leveraging world knowledge for cultural nuances and novel event combinations. These summaries are fused with historical demand features within a dual-tower architecture, enabling accurate, explainable, and scalable forecasts. Deployed on real-world e-commerce scenarios spanning 4 countries of 160 regions over 10 months, EventCast achieves up to 86.9% and 97.7% improvement on MAE and MSE compared to the variant without event knowledge, and reduces MAE by up to 57.0% and MSE by 83.3% versus the best industrial baseline during event-driven periods.

To this end, we propose to leverage local and global density characteristics to guide the model of crowd counting for unseen surveillance scenes. Specifically, to enable the model to adapt to the varying density variations in the target scene, we propose the multiple local density learner to learn multi prototypes which represent different density distributions in the support scene. Subsequently, these multiple local density similarity matrixes are encoded. And they are utilized to guide the model in a local way. To further adapt to the global density in the target scene, the global density features are extracted from the support image, then it is used to guide the model in a global way. Experiments on three surveillance datasets shows that proposed method can adapt to the unseen surveillance scene and outperform recent state-of-the-art methods in the few-shot crowd counting."}

We validate IVSR through detailed case-study simulations provided by an industrial partner, demonstrating capabilities in localized incident detection, privacy-preserving playback, collider-based fire-spread projection, and site-specific ML retraining.

Recent studies have shown that using differentiable rewards to directly align the preference of diffusion models yields promising results. However, these methods suffer from (1) inefficient and coarse-grained optimization with (2) high memory consumption. In this work, we first theoretically and empirically identify the key reason of these limitations: the recursive dependence between different steps in the denoising trajectory. Inspired by this insight, we propose EasyTune, which fine-tunes diffusion at each denoising step rather than over the entire trajectory. This decouples the recursive dependence, allowing us to perform (1) a dense and fine-grained, and (2) memory-efficient optimization. Furthermore, the scarcity of preference motion pairs restricts the availability of motion reward model training. To this end, we further introduce a Self-refinement Preference Learning (SPL) mechanism that dynamically identifies preference pairs and conducts preference learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EasyTune outperforms DRaFT-50 by 8.2% in alignment (MM-Dist) improvement while requiring only 31.16% of its additional memory overhead and achieving a 7.3x training speedup.

These subsystems are supported by foundational capabilities for deep research, solution optimization, and long horizon memory. The architecture allows InternAgent-1.5 to operate continuously across extended discovery cycles while maintaining coherent and improving behavior. It also enables the system to coordinate computational modeling and laboratory experimentation within a single unified system. We evaluate InternAgent-1.5 on scientific reasoning benchmarks such as GAIA, HLE, GPQA, and FrontierScience, and the system achieves leading performance that demonstrates strong foundational capabilities. Beyond these benchmarks, we further assess two categories of discovery tasks. In algorithm discovery tasks, InternAgent-1.5 autonomously designs competitive methods for core machine learning problems. In empirical discovery tasks, it executes complete computational or wet lab experiments and produces scientific findings in earth, life, biological, and physical domains. Overall, these results show that InternAgent-1.5 provides a general and scalable framework for autonomous scientific discovery."}

Concerningly, a pre-registered survey of experts failed to predict this result, highlighting our poor understanding of the inductive biases governing learning and generalisation in LLMs. We use emergent misalignment (EM) as a case study to investigate these inductive biases and find that models can just learn the narrow dataset task, but that the general solution appears to be more stable and more efficient. To establish this, we build on the result that different EM finetunes converge to the same linear representation of general misalignment, which can be used to mediate misaligned behaviour. We find a linear representation of the narrow solution also exists, and can be learned by introducing a KL divergence loss. Comparing these representations reveals that general misalignment achieves lower loss, is more robust to perturbations, and is more influential in the pre-training distribution. This work isolates a concrete representation of general misalignment for monitoring and mitigation. More broadly, it offers a detailed case study and preliminary metrics for investigating how inductive biases shape generalisation in LLMs. We open-source all code, datasets and model finetunes."}

However, under ultra-low-dose conditions, the sharply degraded signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in energy-specific projections poses a significant challenge, leading to severe artifacts and loss of structural details in reconstructed images. To address this, we propose FSP-Diff, a full-spectrum prior-enhanced dual-domain latent diffusion framework for ultra-low-dose spectral CT reconstruction. Our framework integrates three core strategies: 1) Complementary Feature Construction: We integrate direct image reconstructions with projection-domain denoised results. While the former preserves latent textural nuances amidst heavy noise, the latter provides a stable structural scaffold to balance detail fidelity and noise suppression. 2) Full-Spectrum Prior Integration: By fusing multi-energy projections into a high-SNR full-spectrum image, we establish a unified structural reference that guides the reconstruction across all energy bins. 3) Efficient Latent Diffusion Synthesis: To alleviate the high computational burden of high-dimensional spectral data, multi-path features are embedded into a compact latent space. This allows the diffusion process to facilitate interactive feature fusion in a lower-dimensional manifold, achieving accelerated reconstruction while maintaining fine-grained detail restoration. Extensive experiments on simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that FSP-Diff significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both image quality and computational efficiency, underscoring its potential for clinically viable ultra-low-dose spectral CT imaging."}

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a framework for aligning these models with task-specific rewards, improving overall quality and reliability. Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is an efficient, value-function-free alternative to Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) that leverages group-relative reward normalization. We introduce Iterative Group Relative Policy Optimization (iGRPO), a two-stage extension of GRPO that adds dynamic self-conditioning through model-generated drafts. In Stage 1, iGRPO samples multiple exploratory drafts and selects the highest-reward draft using the same scalar reward signal used for optimization. In Stage 2, it appends this best draft to the original prompt and applies a GRPO-style update on draft-conditioned refinements, training the policy to improve beyond its strongest prior attempt. Under matched rollout budgets, iGRPO consistently outperforms GRPO across base models (e.g., Nemotron-H-8B-Base-8K and DeepSeek-R1 Distilled), validating its effectiveness on diverse reasoning benchmarks. Moreover, applying iGRPO to OpenReasoning-Nemotron-7B trained on AceReason-Math achieves new state-of-the-art results of 85.62\\% and 79.64\\% on AIME24 and AIME25, respectively. Ablations further show that the refinement wrapper generalizes beyond GRPO variants, benefits from a generative judge, and alters learning dynamics by delaying entropy collapse.

To address this gap, we introduce EXPERIGEN, an agentic framework that operationalizes end-to-end discovery through a Bayesian optimization inspired two-phase search, in which a Generator proposes candidate hypotheses and an Experimenter evaluates them empirically. Across multiple domains, EXPERIGEN consistently discovers 2-4x more statistically significant hypotheses that are 7-17 percent more predictive than prior approaches, and naturally extends to complex data regimes including multimodal and relational datasets. Beyond statistical performance, hypotheses must be novel, empirically grounded, and actionable to drive real scientific progress. To evaluate these qualities, we conduct an expert review of machine-generated hypotheses, collecting feedback from senior faculty. Among 25 reviewed hypotheses, 88 percent were rated moderately or strongly novel, 70 percent were deemed impactful and worth pursuing, and most demonstrated rigor comparable to senior graduate-level research.

Ultra-sparse angular sampling, employed to reduce dose, introduces severe undersampling artifacts and inter-slice inconsistencies, compromising diagnostic reliability. Existing reconstruction methods often struggle to balance angular continuity with spatial detail fidelity. To address these challenges, we propose a Continuity-driven Synergistic Diffusion with Neural priors (CSDN) for ultra-sparse-view CBCT reconstruction. Neural priors are introduced as a structural foundation to encode a continuous threedimensional attenuation representation, enabling the synthesis of physically consistent dense projections from ultra-sparse measurements. Building upon this neural-prior-based initialization, a synergistic diffusion strategy is developed, consisting of two collaborative refinement paths: a Sinogram Refinement Diffusion (Sino-RD) process that restores angular continuity and a Digital Radiography Refinement Diffusion (DR-RD) process that enforces inter-slice consistency from the projection image perspective. The outputs of the two diffusion paths are adaptively fused by the Dual-Projection Reconstruction Fusion (DPRF) module to achieve coherent volumetric reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed CSDN effectively suppresses artifacts and recovers fine textures under ultra-sparse-view conditions, outperforming existing state-of-the-art techniques."}

Current LLM research is dominated by a paradigm that relies heavily on unidirectional scaling of data size, increasingly encountering bottlenecks in data availability, acquisition cost, and training efficiency. In this work, we argue that the development of AGI is entering a new phase of data-model co-evolution, in which models actively guide data management while high-quality data, in turn, amplifies model capabilities. To implement this vision, we propose a tiered data management framework, designed to support the full LLM training lifecycle across heterogeneous learning objectives and cost constraints. Specifically, we introduce an L0-L4 tiered data management framework, ranging from raw uncurated resources to organized and verifiable knowledge. Importantly, LLMs are fully used in data management processes, such as quality scoring and content editing, to refine data across tiers. Each tier is characterized by distinct data properties, management strategies, and training roles, enabling data to be strategically allocated across LLM training stages, including pre-training, mid-training, and alignment. The framework balances data quality, acquisition cost, and marginal training benefit, providing a systematic approach to scalable and sustainable data management. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework through empirical studies, in which tiered datasets are constructed from raw corpora and used across multiple training phases. Experimental results demonstrate that tier-aware data utilization significantly improves training efficiency and model performance. To facilitate further research, we release our tiered datasets and processing tools to the community."}

We frame such an agent coordination challenge as a classic problem in dynamic ad-hoc networking: How to establish adaptive and reliable communication among a scalable number of agentic hosts? In response to this unresolved dilemma, we introduce RAPS, a reputation-aware publish-subscribe paradigm for adaptive, scalable, and robust coordination of LLM agents. RAPS is grounded in the Distributed Publish-Subscribe Protocol, allowing LLM agents to exchange messages based on their declared intents rather than predefined topologies. Beyond this substrate, RAPS further incorporates two coherent overlays: (i) Reactive Subscription, enabling agents to dynamically refine their intents; and (ii) Bayesian Reputation, empowering each agent with a local watchdog to detect and isolate malicious peers. Extensive experiments over five benchmarks showcase that our design effectively reconciles adaptivity, scalability, and robustness in a unified multi-agent coordination framework."}

Existing VLLMs acceleration frameworks usually compress spatial and temporal redundancy independently, which overlooks the spatiotemporal relationships, thereby leading to suboptimal spatiotemporal compression. The highly correlated visual features are likely to change in spatial position, scale, orientation, and other attributes over time due to the dynamic nature of video. Building on this insight, we introduce FlashVID, a training-free inference acceleration framework for VLLMs. Specifically, FlashVID utilizes Attention and Diversity-based Token Selection (ADTS) to select the most representative tokens for basic video representation, then applies Tree-based Spatiotemporal Token Merging (TSTM) for fine-grained spatiotemporal redundancy elimination. Extensive experiments conducted on three representative VLLMs across five video understanding benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our method. Notably, by retaining only 10% of visual tokens, FlashVID preserves 99.1% of the performance of LLaVA-OneVision. Consequently, FlashVID can serve as a training-free and plug-and-play module for extending long video frames, which enables a 10x increase in video frame input to Qwen2.5-VL, resulting in a relative improvement of 8.6% within the same computational budget.

To this end, we propose MCIE-E1, a Multimodal Large Language Model-Driven Complex Instruction Image Editing method that integrates two key modules: a spatial-aware cross-attention module and a background-consistent cross-attention module. The former enhances instruction-following capability by explicitly aligning semantic instructions with spatial regions through spatial guidance during the denoising process, while the latter preserves features in unedited regions to maintain background consistency. To enable effective training, we construct a dedicated data pipeline to mitigate the scarcity of complex instruction-based image editing datasets, combining fine-grained automatic filtering via a powerful MLLM with rigorous human validation. Finally, to comprehensively evaluate complex instruction-based image editing, we introduce CIE-Bench, a new benchmark with two new evaluation metrics.

To break this cycle, we propose Free()LM, a model that introduces an intrinsic self-forgetting capability via the Free-Module, a plug-and-play LoRA adapter. By iteratively switching between reasoning and cleaning modes, Free()LM dynamically identifies and prunes useless context chunks, maintaining a compact and noise-free state.\n  Extensive experiments show that Free()LM provides consistent improvements across all model scales (8B to 685B).

This makes current methods sensitive to error accumulation and prevents learning spatio-temporal features directly from images. In this work, we present ForecastOcc, the first framework for vision-based semantic occupancy forecasting that jointly predicts future occupancy states and semantic categories. Our framework yields semantic occupancy forecasts for multiple horizons directly from past camera images, without relying on externally estimated maps. We evaluate ForecastOcc in two complementary settings: multi-view forecasting on the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset and monocular forecasting on SemanticKITTI, where we establish the first benchmark for this task. We introduce the first baselines by adapting two 2D forecasting modules within our framework. Importantly, we propose a novel architecture that incorporates a temporal cross-attention forecasting module, a 2D-to-3D view transformer, a 3D encoder for occupancy prediction, and a semantic occupancy head for voxel-level forecasts across multiple horizons.

Our results show that, despite visual rendering, reintegrating a text tokenizer into the architecture reintroduces the same issue that pixel-based language modeling aims to resolve, which is the tokenizer misalignment problem. Despite having lower OOV and fertility rates, we show that the Llama 2 tokenizer performs significantly worse than a custom tokenizer, with improvements of up to 30.15 chrF++.

Recent work addresses this by augmenting reasoning with world models for visual imagination, but questions such as when imagination is actually necessary, how much of it is beneficial, and when it becomes harmful, remain poorly understood. In practice, indiscriminate imagination can increase computation and even degrade performance by introducing misleading evidence. In this work, we present an in-depth analysis of test-time visual imagination as a controllable resource for spatial reasoning. We study when static visual evidence is sufficient, when imagination improves reasoning, and how excessive or unnecessary imagination affects accuracy and efficiency. To support this analysis, we introduce AVIC, an adaptive test-time framework with world models that explicitly reasons about the sufficiency of current visual evidence before selectively invoking and scaling visual imagination. Across spatial reasoning benchmarks (SAT, MMSI) and an embodied navigation benchmark (R2R), our results reveal clear scenarios where imagination is critical, marginal, or detrimental, and show that selective control can match or outperform fixed imagination strategies with substantially fewer world-model calls and language tokens.

Crucially, we integrate a differentiable two-stage solver: first, a learnable Force Solver iteratively resolves unbalanced forces derived from the Saint Venant-Kirchhoff (StVK) model to ensure quasi-static equilibrium; second, a Differentiable Projection strictly enforces collision constraints against the body surface. This differentiable design guarantees physical validity through explicit constraints, while enabling end-to-end learning to optimize the network for physically consistent predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PhysDrape achieves state-of-the-art performance, ensuring negligible interpenetration with significantly lower strain energy compared to existing baselines, achieving superior physical fidelity and robustness in real-time."}

To evaluate BiomechAgent's capabilities, we developed a systematic benchmark spanning data retrieval, visualization, activity classification, temporal segmentation, and clinical reasoning. BiomechAgent achieved robust accuracy on data retrieval and visualization tasks and demonstrated emerging clinical reasoning capabilities. We used our dataset to systematically evaluate several of our design decisions. Biomechanically-informed, domain-specific instructions significantly improved performance over generic prompts, and integrating validated specialized tools for gait event detection substantially boosted accuracy on challenging spatiotemporal analysis where the base agent struggled. We also tested BiomechAgent using a local open-weight model instead of a frontier cloud based LLM and found that perform was substantially diminished in most domains other than database retrieval. In short, BiomechAgent makes the data from accessible motion capture and much more useful and accessible to end users."}

Existing agent memory systems are typically designed within isolated paradigms (e.g., explicit, parametric, or latent memory) with tightly coupled retrieval methods that hinder cross-paradigm generalization and fusion. In this work, we take a first step toward unifying heterogeneous memory paradigms within a single memory system. We propose MemAdapter, a memory retrieval framework that enables fast alignment across agent memory paradigms. MemAdapter adopts a two-stage training strategy: (1) training a generative subgraph retriever from the unified memory space, and (2) adapting the retriever to unseen memory paradigms by training a lightweight alignment module through contrastive learning. This design improves the flexibility for memory retrieval and substantially reduces alignment cost across paradigms. Comprehensive experiments on three public evaluation benchmarks demonstrate that the generative subgraph retriever consistently outperforms five strong agent memory systems across three memory paradigms and agent model scales. Notably, MemAdapter completes cross-paradigm alignment within 13 minutes on a single GPU, achieving superior performance over original memory retrievers with less than 5% of training compute. Furthermore, MemAdapter enables effective zero-shot fusion across memory paradigms, highlighting its potential as a plug-and-play solution for agent memory systems."}

Existing VLLMs acceleration frameworks usually compress spatial and temporal redundancy independently, which overlooks the spatiotemporal relationships, thereby leading to suboptimal spatiotemporal compression. The highly correlated visual features are likely to change in spatial position, scale, orientation, and other attributes over time due to the dynamic nature of video. Building on this insight, we introduce FlashVID, a training-free inference acceleration framework for VLLMs. Specifically, FlashVID utilizes Attention and Diversity-based Token Selection (ADTS) to select the most representative tokens for basic video representation, then applies Tree-based Spatiotemporal Token Merging (TSTM) for fine-grained spatiotemporal redundancy elimination. Extensive experiments conducted on three representative VLLMs across five video understanding benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our method. Notably, by retaining only 10% of visual tokens, FlashVID preserves 99.1% of the performance of LLaVA-OneVision. Consequently, FlashVID can serve as a training-free and plug-and-play module for extending long video frames, which enables a 10x increase in video frame input to Qwen2.5-VL, resulting in a relative improvement of 8.6% within the same computational budget.

In this paper, we propose ILA-agent, a general ILA framework that equips LLMs with a set of behavioral primitives. By modeling essential human-like behaviors as a suite of tools, ILA-agent enables LLMs to incrementally explore, apply, and verify language knowledge through structured interactions with the official documentation and execution environment. To provide a rigorous evaluation in a low-resource setting, we construct Cangjie-bench, a multi-task benchmark based on the novel statically-typed language Cangjie.

This augmentation simultaneously improves sample efficiency due to rollout reuse and stabilizes RL optimization through balanced supervision. Furthermore, we introduce a response-masking strategy that decouples self-correction from direct reasoning, avoiding signal conflicts and enabling both behaviors to be learned effectively. Building on this, we introduce Octopus-8B, a reasoning VLM with controllable self-correction capability.

We study two representative paradigms (i.e., Coconut and CODI) on both mathematical and general reasoning tasks to investigate three key questions: (1) which steps are causally necessary for correctness and when answers become decidable early; (2) how does influence propagate across steps, and how does this structure compare to explicit CoT; and (3) do intermediate trajectories retain competing answer modes, and how does output-level commitment differ from representational commitment across steps. We find that latent-step budgets behave less like homogeneous extra depth and more like staged functionality with non-local routing, and we identify a persistent gap between early output bias and late representational commitment. These results motivate mode-conditional and stability-aware analyses -- and corresponding training/decoding objectives -- as more reliable tools for interpreting and improving latent reasoning systems."}

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have recently demonstrated strong potential in synthesizing realistic visual data.

These challenges arise mainly from the high computational requirements and the difficulty of modeling heterogeneous and structurally intricate data, which restrict their applicability in real-world settings. Mixture of Experts (MoE) models have emerged as a promising solution to these limitations. By dynamically selecting and activating the most relevant expert sub-networks for a given input, MoEs improve both performance and efficiency. In this paper, we investigate the integration of Deep 3D Convolutional GANs (CGANs) with a MoE framework to generate high-quality 3D models and reconstruct incomplete or damaged objects. The proposed architecture incorporates multiple generators, each specialized to capture distinct modalities within the dataset. Furthermore, an auxiliary loss-free dynamic capacity constraint (DCC) mechanism is introduced to guide the selection of categorical generators, ensuring a balance between specialization, training stability, and computational efficiency, which is critical for 3D voxel processing. We evaluated the model's ability to generate and complete shapes with missing regions of varying sizes and compared its performance with state-of-the-art approaches.

The controller consumes full-trace confidence to decide whether to halt, re-examine, or try a different approach, enabling targeted self-correction with an average of 2.7 refinement steps per problem and roughly 190-fold token reduction relative to 512-sample baselines. Across diverse reasoning benchmarks and three open-source models, the controller achieves 92.6 percent precision when it confidently halts, indicating that confidence dynamics reliably signal correctness without ground-truth verification.

Current LLM research is dominated by a paradigm that relies heavily on unidirectional scaling of data size, increasingly encountering bottlenecks in data availability, acquisition cost, and training efficiency. In this work, we argue that the development of AGI is entering a new phase of data-model co-evolution, in which models actively guide data management while high-quality data, in turn, amplifies model capabilities. To implement this vision, we propose a tiered data management framework, designed to support the full LLM training lifecycle across heterogeneous learning objectives and cost constraints. Specifically, we introduce an L0-L4 tiered data management framework, ranging from raw uncurated resources to organized and verifiable knowledge. Importantly, LLMs are fully used in data management processes, such as quality scoring and content editing, to refine data across tiers. Each tier is characterized by distinct data properties, management strategies, and training roles, enabling data to be strategically allocated across LLM training stages, including pre-training, mid-training, and alignment. The framework balances data quality, acquisition cost, and marginal training benefit, providing a systematic approach to scalable and sustainable data management. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework through empirical studies, in which tiered datasets are constructed from raw corpora and used across multiple training phases. Experimental results demonstrate that tier-aware data utilization significantly improves training efficiency and model performance.

For instance, when estimating the poses and shapes of objects in the scene and importing the resulting estimates into a simulator, small errors might translate to implausible configurations including object interpenetration or unstable equilibrium. This makes it difficult to predict the dynamic behavior of the scene using a digital twin, an important step in simulation-based planning and control of contact-rich behaviors. In this paper, we posit that object pose and shape estimation requires reasoning holistically over the scene (instead of reasoning about each object in isolation), accounting for object interactions and physical plausibility. Towards this goal, our first contribution is Picasso, a physics-constrained reconstruction pipeline that builds multi-object scene reconstructions by considering geometry, non-penetration, and physics. Picasso relies on a fast rejection sampling method that reasons over multi-object interactions, leveraging an inferred object contact graph to guide samples. Second, we propose the Picasso dataset, a collection of 10 contact-rich real-world scenes with ground truth annotations, as well as a metric to quantify physical plausibility, which we open-source as part of our benchmark.

To address these limitations, we propose XAI-CLIP, an ROI-guided perturbation framework that leverages multimodal vision-language model embeddings to localize clinically meaningful anatomical regions and guide the explanation process. By integrating language-informed region localization with medical image segmentation and applying targeted, region-aware perturbations, the proposed method generates clearer, boundary-aware saliency maps while substantially reducing computational overhead. Experiments conducted on the FLARE22 and CHAOS datasets demonstrate that XAI-CLIP achieves up to a 60\\% reduction in runtime, a 44.6\\% improvement in dice score, and a 96.7\\% increase in Intersection-over-Union for occlusion-based explanations compared to conventional perturbation methods. Qualitative results further confirm cleaner and more anatomically consistent attribution maps with fewer artifacts, highlighting that the incorporation of multimodal vision-language representations into perturbation-based XAI frameworks significantly enhances both interpretability and efficiency, thereby enabling transparent and clinically deployable medical image segmentation systems."}

In deployed platforms, this raises copyright and intellectual-property risks and calls for reliable protection. However, existing countermeasures either require costly weight editing as new styles emerge or rely on an explicitly specified editing style, limiting their practicality for deployment-side safety. To address this challenge, we propose DICE (Disentanglement of artist Style from Content via Contrastive Subspace Decomposition), a training-free framework for on-the-fly artist style erasure. Unlike style editing that require an explicitly specified replacement style, DICE performs style purification, removing the artist's characteristics while preserving the user-intended content. Our core insight is that a model cannot truly comprehend the artist style from a single text or image alone. Consequently, we abandon the traditional paradigm of identifying style from isolated samples. Instead, we construct contrastive triplets to compel the model to distinguish between style and non-style features in the latent space. By formalizing this disentanglement process as a solvable generalized eigenvalue problem, we achieve precise identification of the style subspace. Furthermore, we introduce an Adaptive Attention Decoupling Editing strategy dynamically assesses the style concentration of each token and performs differential suppression and content enhancement on the QKV vectors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DICE achieves a superior balance between the thoroughness of style erasure and the preservation of content integrity. DICE introduces an additional overhead of only 3 seconds to disentangle style, providing a practical and efficient technique for curbing style mimicry."}

Here, we propose a mechanistic insight by analyzing the representational geometry of open-weight VLMs (Qwen, InternVL, Gemma), comparing methodologies to distill \"concept vectors\" - latent directions encoding visual concepts. We validate our concept vectors via steering interventions that reliably manipulate model behavior in both simplified and naturalistic vision tasks (e.g., forcing the model to perceive a red flower as blue). We observe that the geometric overlap between these vectors strongly correlates with specific error patterns, offering a grounded quantitative framework to understand how internal representations shape model behavior and drive visual failures."}

Existing methods typically adapt pre-trained video models using camera poses relative to a fixed reference, e.g., the first frame. However, these encodings lack shift-invariance, often leading to poor generalization and accumulated drift. While relative camera pose embeddings defined between arbitrary view pairs offer a more robust alternative, integrating them into pre-trained video diffusion models without prohibitive training costs or architectural changes remains challenging. We introduce ReRoPE, a plug-and-play framework that incorporates relative camera information into pre-trained video diffusion models without compromising their generation capability. Our approach is based on the insight that Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE) in existing models underutilize their full spectral bandwidth, particularly in the low-frequency components. By seamlessly injecting relative camera pose information into these underutilized bands, ReRoPE achieves precise control while preserving strong pre-trained generative priors. We evaluate our method on both image-to-video (I2V) and video-to-video (V2V) tasks in terms of camera control accuracy and visual fidelity. Our results demonstrate that ReRoPE offers a training-efficient path toward controllable, high-fidelity video generation. See project page for more results: https://sisyphe-lee.github.io/ReRoPE/"}

Prior approaches to bridge this gap are largely limited by oversimplified isotropic assumptions, hindering their application in large-scale scenarios. In this paper, we address these limitations by precisely characterizing the geometric shape of the modality gap and leveraging it for efficient model scaling. First, we propose the Fixed-frame Modality Gap Theory, which decomposes the modality gap within a frozen reference frame into stable biases and anisotropic residuals. Guided by this precise modeling, we introduce ReAlign, a training-free modality alignment strategy. Utilizing statistics from massive unpaired data, ReAlign aligns text representation into the image representation distribution via a three-step process comprising Anchor, Trace, and Centroid Alignment, thereby explicitly rectifying geometric misalignment. Building on ReAlign, we propose ReVision, a scalable training paradigm for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). ReVision integrates ReAlign into the pretraining stage, enabling the model to learn the distribution of visual representations from unpaired text before visual instruction tuning, without the need for large-scale, high-quality image-text pairs. Our framework demonstrates that statistically aligned unpaired data can effectively substitute for expensive image-text pairs, offering a robust path for the efficient scaling of MLLMs."}

While modern video world models achieve strong performance on intuitive physics benchmarks, it remains unclear which of these representational regimes they implement internally. Here, we present the first interpretability study to directly examine physical representations inside large-scale video encoders. Using layerwise probing, subspace geometry, patch-level decoding, and targeted attention ablations, we characterize where physical information becomes accessible and how it is organized within encoder-based video transformers.\n  Across architectures, we identify a sharp intermediate-depth transition -- which we call the Physics Emergence Zone -- at which physical variables become accessible. Physics-related representations peak shortly after this transition and degrade toward the output layers. Decomposing motion into explicit variables, we find that scalar quantities such as speed and acceleration are available from early layers onwards, whereas motion direction becomes accessible only at the Physics Emergence Zone. Notably, we find that direction is encoded through a high-dimensional population structure with circular geometry, requiring coordinated multi-feature intervention to control. These findings suggest that modern video models do not use factorized representations of physical variables like a classical physics engine.

We introduce FADE (Fast Adapter for Data Erasure), a two-stage unlearning method for image generation that combines parameter localization with self-distillation. FADE first identifies parameters most responsible for the forget set using gradient-based saliency and constrains updates through sparse LoRA adapters, ensuring lightweight, localized modifications.

Recent work proposed several visual jailbreak attacks using single/ holistic images. However, contemporary VLMs demonstrate strong robustness against such attacks due to extensive safety alignment through preference optimization (e.g., RLHF). In this work, we identify a new vulnerability: while VLM pretraining and instruction tuning generalize well to split-image inputs, safety alignment is typically performed only on holistic images and does not account for harmful semantics distributed across multiple image fragments. Consequently, VLMs often fail to detect and refuse harmful split-image inputs, where unsafe cues emerge only after combining images. We introduce novel split-image visual jailbreak attacks (SIVA) that exploit this misalignment. Unlike prior optimization-based attacks, which exhibit poor black-box transferability due to architectural and prior mismatches across models, our attacks evolve in progressive phases from naive splitting to an adaptive white-box attack, culminating in a black-box transfer attack. Our strongest strategy leverages a novel adversarial knowledge distillation (Adv-KD) algorithm to substantially improve cross-model transferability. Evaluations on three state-of-the-art modern VLMs and three jailbreak datasets demonstrate that our strongest attack achieves up to 60% higher transfer success than existing baselines. Lastly, we propose efficient ways to address this critical vulnerability in the current VLM safety alignment."}

For structural fidelity easily affected in ReFL, the model is directly optimized on synthetic pairs at early diffusion steps, which also facilitates structure preservation for real-world inputs under smaller distribution gap in structure levels. For perceptual enhancement, quality-guided rewards are applied at later sampling steps to both synthetic and real LR images. To mitigate reward hacking, the rewards for synthetic results are formulated in a relative advantage space bounded by their clean counterparts, while real-world optimization is regularized via a semantic alignment constraint. Furthermore, to balance structural and perceptual learning, we adopt a dynamic fidelity-perception weighting strategy that emphasizes structure preservation at early stages and progressively shifts focus toward perceptual optimization at later diffusion steps.

However, existing visual language models (VLMs) have very weak capabilities in spatial reasoning due to the lack of knowledge about 3D spatial information, especially when the reasoning task involve complex spatial relations across multiple video frames. In this paper, we present a new inference-time computing technique for on-device embodied AI, namely \\emph{MosaicThinker}, which enhances the on-device small VLM's spatial reasoning capabilities on difficult cross-frame reasoning tasks. Our basic idea is to integrate fragmented spatial information from multiple frames into a unified space representation of global semantic map, and further guide the VLM's spatial reasoning over the semantic map via a visual prompt. Experiment results show that our technique can greatly enhance the accuracy of cross-frame spatial reasoning on resource-constrained embodied AI devices, over reasoning tasks with diverse types and complexities."}

Third, we extend our approach to region-wise concept learning, enabling flexible concept extraction, with context-aware and context-free losses. Extensive experimental results show that PEGAsus is able to effectively extract attributes from a wide range of reference shapes and then flexibly compose these concepts with text to synthesize new shapes. This enables fine-grained control over shape generation and supports the creation of diverse, personalized results, even in challenging cross-category scenarios.

However, these models often face challenges when dealing with implicit editing instructions, which describe the cause of a visual change without explicitly detailing the resulting outcome. These limitations arise because existing models rely on uniform editing strategies that are not equipped to handle the complex world knowledge and reasoning required for implicit instructions. To address this gap, we introduce \\textbf{WorldEdit}, a dataset specifically designed to enable world-driven image editing. WorldEdit consists of high-quality editing samples, guided by paraphrased instructions that align with real-world causal logic. Furthermore, we provide \\textbf{WorldEdit-Test} for evaluating the existing model's performance on causal editing scenarios. With WorldEdit, we use a two-stage training framework for fine-tuning models like Bagel, integrating with a causal verification reward. Our results show that the proposed dataset and methods significantly narrow the gap with GPT-4o and Nano-Banana, demonstrating competitive performance not only in instruction following but also in knowledge plausibility, where many open-source systems typically struggle."}

Inherent noise, artifacts, and limited viewing angles introduce ambiguity, where a single video sequence may map not to a unique ground truth, but rather to a distribution of plausible physiological values. Prevailing deep learning approaches typically formulate this task as a standard regression problem that minimizes the Mean Squared Error (MSE). However, this paradigm compels the model to learn the conditional expectation, which may yield misleading predictions when the underlying posterior distribution is multimodal or heavy-tailed -- a common phenomenon in pathological scenarios. In this paper, we investigate the paradigm shift from deterministic regression toward generative regression. We propose the Multimodal Conditional Score-based Diffusion model for Regression (MCSDR), a probabilistic framework designed to model the continuous posterior distribution of LVEF conditioned on echocardiogram videos and patient demographic attribute priors. Extensive experiments conducted on the EchoNet-Dynamic, EchoNet-Pediatric, and CAMUS datasets demonstrate that MCSDR achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, qualitative analysis reveals that the generation trajectories of our model exhibit distinct behaviors in cases characterized by high noise or significant physiological variability, thereby offering a novel layer of interpretability for AI-aided diagnosis."}

While prior work has studied prompt injection in the text domain and through digitally edited 2D images, it remains unclear how these attacks function in 3D physical environments. To bridge the gap, we introduce PI3D, a prompt injection attack against MLLMs in 3D environments, realized through text-bearing physical object placement rather than digital image edits. We formulate and solve the problem of identifying an effective 3D object pose (position and orientation) with injected text, where the attacker's goal is to induce the MLLM to perform the injected task while ensuring that the object placement remains physically plausible. Experiments demonstrate that PI3D is an effective attack against multiple MLLMs under diverse camera trajectories. We further evaluate existing defenses and show that they are insufficient to defend against PI3D."}

However, existing methods predominantly rely on the passive mapping of visual features and textual embeddings. This ``appearance-based\" paradigm lacks geospatial contextual awareness, leading to severe semantic ambiguity and misclassification when encountering land-cover classes with similar spectral features but distinct semantic attributes. To address this, we propose a Geospatial Reasoning Chain-of-Thought (GR-CoT) framework designed to enhance the scene understanding capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), thereby guiding open-vocabulary segmentation models toward precise mapping. The framework comprises two collaborative components: an offline knowledge distillation stream and an online instance reasoning stream. The offline stream establishes fine-grained category interpretation standards to resolve semantic conflicts between similar land-cover types. During online inference, the framework executes a sequential reasoning process involving macro-scenario anchoring, visual feature decoupling, and knowledge-driven decision synthesis. This process generates an image-adaptive vocabulary that guides downstream models to achieve pixel-level alignment with correct geographical semantics. Extensive experiments on the LoveDA and GID5 benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our approach."}

We propose Expressive Omni (Ex-Omni), an open-source omni-modal framework that augments OLLMs with speech-accompanied 3D facial animation. Ex-Omni reduces learning difficulty by decoupling semantic reasoning from temporal generation, leveraging speech units as temporal scaffolding and a unified token-as-query gated fusion (TQGF) mechanism for controlled semantic injection.

Although there have been efforts to improve the efficiency of SAM2, most of them focus on retraining a lightweight backbone, with little exploration into post-training acceleration. In this paper, we observe that SAM2 exhibits sparse perception pattern as biological vision, which provides opportunities for eliminating redundant computation and acceleration: i) In mask decoder, the attention primarily focuses on the foreground objects, whereas the image encoder in the earlier stage exhibits a broad attention span, which results in unnecessary computation to background regions. ii) In memory bank, only a small subset of tokens in each frame contribute significantly to memory attention, and the salient regions exhibit temporal consistency, making full-token computation redundant. With these insights, we propose Efficient-SAM2, which promotes SAM2 to adaptively focus on object regions while eliminating task-irrelevant computations, thereby significantly improving inference efficiency. Specifically, for image encoder, we propose object-aware Sparse Window Routing (SWR), a window-level computation allocation mechanism that leverages the consistency and saliency cues from the previous-frame decoder to route background regions into a lightweight shortcut branch. Moreover, for memory attention, we propose object-aware Sparse Memory Retrieval (SMR), which allows only the salient memory tokens in each frame to participate in computation, with the saliency pattern reused from their first recollection. With negligible additional parameters and minimal training overhead, Efficient-SAM2 delivers 1.68x speedup on SAM2.1-L model with only 1.0% accuracy drop on SA-V test set."}

Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate a similar flexibility in adopting different personas and behaviors. Existing approaches, however, typically adapt such behavior through external knowledge such as prompting, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), or fine-tuning. We ask: do LLMs really need external context or parameters to adapt to different behaviors, or do they already have such knowledge embedded in their parameters? In this work, we show that LLMs already contain persona-specialized subnetworks in their parameter space. Using small calibration datasets, we identify distinct activation signatures associated with different personas. Guided by these statistics, we develop a masking strategy that isolates lightweight persona subnetworks. Building on the findings, we further discuss: how can we discover opposing subnetwork from the model that lead to binary-opposing personas, such as introvert-extrovert? To further enhance separation in binary opposition scenarios, we introduce a contrastive pruning strategy that identifies parameters responsible for the statistical divergence between opposing personas. Our method is entirely training-free and relies solely on the language model's existing parameter space. Across diverse evaluation settings, the resulting subnetworks exhibit significantly stronger persona alignment than baselines that require external knowledge while being more efficient. Our findings suggest that diverse human-like behaviors are not merely induced in LLMs, but are already embedded in their parameter space, pointing toward a new perspective on controllable and interpretable personalization in large language models."}

Recent work addresses this by augmenting reasoning with world models for visual imagination, but questions such as when imagination is actually necessary, how much of it is beneficial, and when it becomes harmful, remain poorly understood. In practice, indiscriminate imagination can increase computation and even degrade performance by introducing misleading evidence. In this work, we present an in-depth analysis of test-time visual imagination as a controllable resource for spatial reasoning. We study when static visual evidence is sufficient, when imagination improves reasoning, and how excessive or unnecessary imagination affects accuracy and efficiency. To support this analysis, we introduce AVIC, an adaptive test-time framework with world models that explicitly reasons about the sufficiency of current visual evidence before selectively invoking and scaling visual imagination. Across spatial reasoning benchmarks (SAT, MMSI) and an embodied navigation benchmark (R2R), our results reveal clear scenarios where imagination is critical, marginal, or detrimental, and show that selective control can match or outperform fixed imagination strategies with substantially fewer world-model calls and language tokens.

A cornerstone of this transition is video instance insertion, which requires inserting a specific instance into existing footage while maintaining scene integrity. Unlike traditional video editing, this task demands several requirements: precise spatial-temporal placement, physically consistent scene interaction, and the faithful preservation of original dynamics - all achieved under minimal user effort.

We further construct PISCO-Bench, a benchmark with verified instance annotations and paired clean background videos, and evaluate performance using both reference-based and reference-free perceptual metrics.

Furthermore, empirical analysis reveals significant geographic distribution shifts between PA training and test samples, and models trained by directly mixing PO and PA data tend to experience performance degradation due to label noise in PO data. To address this, we draw on the mixture-of-experts paradigm: test samples are partitioned according to their spatial proximity to PA samples, and different models trained on distinct datasets are used for inference and post-processing within each partition. Experiments on the GeoLifeCLEF 2025 dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves superior predictive performance in scenarios with limited PA coverage and pronounced distribution shifts."}

However, existing hallucination standards and evaluation metrics focus primarily on factual correctness, treating all errors as equally severe. This obscures clinically relevant failure modes, particularly when models generate unsupported but actionable medical language. We propose a risk-sensitive evaluation framework that quantifies hallucinations through the presence of risk-bearing language, including treatment directives, contraindications, urgency cues, and mentions of high-risk medications. Rather than assessing clinical correctness, our approach evaluates the potential impact of hallucinated content if acted upon. We further combine risk scoring with a relevance measure to identify high-risk, low-grounding failures. We apply this framework to three instruction-tuned language models using controlled patient-facing prompts designed as safety stress tests. Our results show that models with similar surface-level behavior exhibit substantially different risk profiles and that standard evaluation metrics fail to capture these distinctions. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating risk sensitivity into hallucination evaluation and suggest that evaluation validity is critically dependent on task and prompt design."}

To address this challenge, we proposed a novel Caption-aligned and Agreement-guided Enhancement framework (CAE-AV) for audio-visual learning, which used two complementary modules: Cross-modal Agreement-guided Spatio-Temporal Enrichment (CASTE) and Caption-Aligned Saliency-guided Enrichment (CASE) to relieve audio-visual misalignment. CASTE dynamically balances spatial and temporal relations by evaluating frame-level audio-visual agreement, ensuring that key information is captured from both preceding and subsequent frames under misalignment. CASE injects cross-modal semantic guidance into selected spatio-temporal positions, leveraging high-level semantic cues to further alleviate misalignment. In addition, we design lightweight objectives, caption-to-modality InfoNCE, visual-audio consistency, and entropy regularization to guide token selection and strengthen cross-modal semantic alignment.

Users often employ follow-up questions to refine their intent, expecting LLMs to adapt dynamically. However, recent research reveals that LLMs suffer a substantial performance drop in multi-turn settings compared to single-turn interactions with fully specified instructions, a phenomenon termed ``Lost in Conversation'' (LiC). While this prior work attributes LiC to model unreliability, we argue that the root cause lies in an intent alignment gap rather than intrinsic capability deficits. In this paper, we first demonstrate that LiC is not a failure of model capability but rather a breakdown in interaction between users and LLMs. We theoretically show that scaling model size or improving training alone cannot resolve this gap, as it arises from structural ambiguity in conversational context rather than representational limitations. To address this, we propose to decouple intent understanding from task execution through a Mediator-Assistant architecture. By utilizing an experience-driven Mediator to explicate user inputs into explicit, well-structured instructions based on historical interaction patterns, our approach effectively bridges the gap between vague user intent and model interpretation. Experimental results demonstrate that this method significantly mitigates performance degradation in multi-turn conversations across diverse LLMs."}

In this paradigm, increasing the number of tokens is a common approach to improving motion reconstruction quality, but more tokens make it more difficult for generative models to learn. To maintain high reconstruction quality while reducing generation complexity, we propose leveraging language to achieve efficient motion tokenization, which we term Language-Guided Tokenization (LG-Tok). LG-Tok aligns natural language with motion at the tokenization stage, yielding compact, high-level semantic representations. This approach not only strengthens both tokenization and detokenization but also simplifies the learning of generative models. Furthermore, existing tokenizers predominantly adopt convolutional architectures, whose local receptive fields struggle to support global language guidance. To this end, we propose a Transformer-based Tokenizer that leverages attention mechanisms to enable effective alignment between language and motion. Additionally, we design a language-drop scheme, in which language conditions are randomly removed during training, enabling the detokenizer to support language-free guidance during generation. On the HumanML3D and Motion-X generation benchmarks, LG-Tok achieves Top-1 scores of 0.542 and 0.582, outperforming state-of-the-art methods (MARDM: 0.500 and 0.528), and with FID scores of 0.057 and 0.088, respectively, versus 0.114 and 0.147.

Hence, we propose CLARITY that dynamically adapts its fusion strategy to the detected scene condition. Guided by vision-language model (VLM) priors, the network learns to modulate each modality's contribution based on the illumination state while leveraging object embeddings for segmentation, rather than applying a fixed fusion policy. We further introduce two mechanisms, i.e., one which preserves valid dark-object semantics that prior noise-suppression methods incorrectly discard, and a hierarchical decoder that enforces structural consistency across scales to sharpen boundaries on thin objects.

This necessitates Process Reward Models (PRMs) for distinguishing positive and negative reasoning steps, yet existing benchmarks for PRMs are predominantly text-centric and lack comprehensive assessment under this paradigm. To address these gaps, this work introduces the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for evaluating PRMs under the thinking with images paradigm. Our main contributions are: (1) Through extensive analysis of reasoning trajectories and guided search experiments with PRMs, we define 7 fine-grained error types and demonstrate both the necessity for specialized PRMs and the potential for improvement. (2) We construct a comprehensive benchmark comprising 1,206 manually annotated thinking with images reasoning trajectories spanning 4 categories and 16 subcategories for fine-grained evaluation of PRMs. (3) Our experimental analysis reveals that current LVLMs fall short as effective PRMs, exhibiting limited capabilities in visual reasoning process evaluation with significant performance disparities across error types, positive evaluation bias, and sensitivity to reasoning step positions.

However, single time-point segmentations fail to capture the biological heterogeneity and temporal evolution of stroke. We propose a bi-temporal analysis framework that characterizes ischemic tissue using statistical descriptors, radiomic texture features, and deep feature embeddings from two architectures (mJ-Net and nnU-Net). Bi-temporal refers to admission (T1) and post-treatment follow-up (T2). All features are extracted at T1 from CTP, with follow-up DWI aligned to ensure spatial correspondence. Manually delineated masks at T1 and T2 are intersected to construct six regions of interest (ROIs) encoding both initial tissue state and final outcome. Features were aggregated per region and analyzed in feature space. Evaluation on 18 patients with successful reperfusion demonstrated meaningful clustering of region-level representations. Regions classified as penumbra or healthy at T1 that ultimately recovered exhibited feature similarity to preserved brain tissue, whereas infarct-bound regions formed distinct groupings. Both baseline GLCM and deep embeddings showed a similar trend: penumbra regions exhibit features that are significantly different depending on final state, whereas this difference is not significant for core regions. Deep feature spaces, particularly mJ-Net, showed strong separation between salvageable and non-salvageable tissue, with a penumbra separation index that differed significantly from zero (Wilcoxon signed-rank test).

While existing animal identification methods excel in controlled, single-camera settings, they face severe challenges regarding cross-camera generalization. When models trained on source cameras are deployed to new monitoring nodes characterized by divergent illumination, backgrounds, viewpoints, and heterogeneous imaging properties, recognition performance often degrades dramatically. This limits the large-scale application of non-contact technologies in dynamic, real-world farming environments. To address this challenge, this study proposes a cross-camera cow identification framework based on disentangled representation learning. This framework leverages the Subspace Identifiability Guarantee (SIG) theory in the context of bovine visual recognition. By modeling the underlying physical data generation process, we designed a principle-driven feature disentanglement module that decomposes observed images into multiple orthogonal latent subspaces. This mechanism effectively isolates stable, identity-related biometric features that remain invariant across cameras, thereby substantially improving generalization to unseen cameras. We constructed a high-quality dataset spanning five distinct camera nodes, covering heterogeneous acquisition devices and complex variations in lighting and angles.

Alongside this, we propose Demo-ICL-Bench, a challenging benchmark designed to evaluate demo-driven video in-context learning capabilities. Demo-ICL-Bench is constructed from 1200 instructional YouTube videos with associated questions, from which two types of demonstrations are derived: (i) summarizing video subtitles for text demonstration; and (ii) corresponding instructional videos as video demonstrations. To effectively tackle this new challenge, we develop Demo-ICL, an MLLM with a two-stage training strategy: video-supervised fine-tuning and information-assisted direct preference optimization, jointly enhancing the model's ability to learn from in-context examples.

The approach combines geological modelling, synthetic data generation, and supervised image segmentation to address limited real data and class imbalance. First, discrete fracture network models are used to generate synthetic jointed rock images at field-relevant scales via parametric modelling, preserving joint persistence, connectivity, and node-type distributions. Second, segmentation models are trained using mixed training and pretraining followed by fine-tuning on real images. The method is tested in box and slope domains using several real datasets. The results show that synthetic data can support supervised joint trace detection when real data are scarce. Mixed training performs well when real labels are consistent (e.g. box-domain), while fine-tuning is more robust when labels are noisy (e.g. slope-domain where labels can be biased, incomplete, and inconsistent). Fully zero-shot prediction from synthetic model remains limited, but useful generalisation is achieved by fine-tuning with a small number of real data. Qualitative analysis shows clearer and more geologically meaningful joint traces than indicated by quantitative metrics alone. The proposed method supports reliable joint mapping and provides a basis for further work on domain adaptation and evaluation."}

We present Vista, a novel framework for scene-aware streaming video QA that enables efficient and scalable reasoning over continuous video streams. The innovation of Vista can be summarized in three aspects: (1) scene-aware segmentation, where Vista dynamically clusters incoming frames into temporally and visually coherent scene units; (2) scene-aware compression, where each scene is compressed into a compact token representation and stored in GPU memory for efficient index-based retrieval, while full-resolution frames are offloaded to CPU memory; and (3) scene-aware recall, where relevant scenes are selectively recalled and reintegrated into the model input upon receiving a query, enabling both efficiency and completeness. Vista is model-agnostic and integrates seamlessly with a variety of vision-language backbones, enabling long-context reasoning without compromising latency or memory efficiency. Extensive experiments on StreamingBench demonstrate that Vista achieves state-of-the-art performance, establishing a strong baseline for real-world streaming video understanding."}

In this work, we conduct an in-depth investigation of this asymmetry throughout training evolution and show that, even on the same task, improving generation does not lead to corresponding improvements in self-verification. Interestingly, we find that the reverse direction of this asymmetry behaves differently: learning to self-verify can effectively improve generation performance, achieving accuracy comparable to standard generation training while yielding more efficient and effective reasoning traces. Building on this observation, we further explore integrating self-verification into generation training by formulating a multi-task reinforcement learning framework, where generation and self-verification are optimized as two independent but complementary objectives.

Current methods primarily focus on spatial-temporal modeling or independent frequency domain analysis, lacking a unified framework for joint optimization across spatial, temporal, and frequency domains. This limitation hinders the model's ability to leverage information from all domains simultaneously, leading to suboptimal generation quality. Additionally, in motion generation frameworks, motion-irrelevant cues caused by noise are often entangled with features that contribute positively to generation, thereby leading to motion distortion. To address these issues, we propose Tri-Domain Causal Text-to-Motion Generation (TriC-Motion), a novel diffusion-based framework integrating spatial-temporal-frequency-domain modeling with causal intervention. TriC-Motion includes three core modeling modules for domain-specific modeling, namely Temporal Motion Encoding, Spatial Topology Modeling, and Hybrid Frequency Analysis. After comprehensive modeling, a Score-guided Tri-domain Fusion module integrates valuable information from the triple domains, simultaneously ensuring temporal consistency, spatial topology, motion trends, and dynamics. Moreover, the Causality-based Counterfactual Motion Disentangler is meticulously designed to expose motion-irrelevant cues to eliminate noise, disentangling the real modeling contributions of each domain for superior generation. Extensive experimental results validate that TriC-Motion achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, attaining an outstanding R@1 of 0.612 on the HumanML3D dataset. These results demonstrate its capability to generate high-fidelity, coherent, diverse, and text-aligned motion sequences. Code is available at: https://caoyiyang1105.github.io/TriC-Motion/."}

While Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve strong performance on coarse-grained visual tasks, they often struggle with Fine-Grained Visual Recognition (FGVR). Adapting general-purpose MLLMs to FGVR typically requires large amounts of annotated data, which is costly to obtain, leaving a substantial performance gap compared to contrastive CLIP models dedicated for discriminative tasks. Moreover, MLLMs tend to overfit to seen sub-categories and generalize poorly to unseen ones. To address these challenges, we propose Fine-R1, an MLLM tailored for FGVR through an R1-style training framework: (1) Chain-of-Thought Supervised Fine-tuning, where we construct a high-quality FGVR CoT dataset with rationales of \"visual analysis, candidate sub-categories, comparison, and prediction\", transition the model into a strong open-world classifier; and (2) Triplet Augmented Policy Optimization, where Intra-class Augmentation mixes trajectories from anchor and positive images within the same category to improve robustness to intra-class variance, while Inter-class Augmentation maximizes the response distinction conditioned on images across sub-categories to enhance discriminative ability. With only 4-shot training, Fine-R1 outperforms existing general MLLMs, reasoning MLLMs, and even contrastive CLIP models in identifying both seen and unseen sub-categories, showing promise in working in knowledge-intensive domains where gathering expert annotations for all sub-categories is arduous.

To address this challenge, we introduce AD-MIR, a framework designed to decode advertising intent via a two-stage architecture. First, in the Structure-Aware Memory Construction phase, the system converts raw video into a structured database by integrating semantic retrieval with exact keyword matching. This approach prioritizes fine-grained brand details (e.g., logos, on-screen text) while dynamically filtering out irrelevant background noise to isolate key protagonists. Second, the Structured Reasoning Agent mimics a marketing expert through an iterative inquiry loop, decomposing the narrative to deduce implicit persuasion tactics. Crucially, it employs an evidence-based self-correction mechanism that rigorously validates these insights against specific video frames, automatically backtracking when visual support is lacking. Evaluation on the AdsQA benchmark demonstrates that AD-MIR achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing the strongest general-purpose agent, DVD, by 1.8% in strict and 9.5% in relaxed accuracy.

This augmentation simultaneously improves sample efficiency due to rollout reuse and stabilizes RL optimization through balanced supervision.

Here, we study this question for the problem of mitochondria segmentation in electron microscopy (EM) images, using two popular public EM datasets (Lucchi++ and VNC) and three recent representative VFMs (DINOv2, DINOv3, and OpenCLIP). We evaluate two practical model adaptation regimes: a frozen-backbone setting in which only a lightweight segmentation head is trained on top of the VFM, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) in which the VFM is fine-tuned in a targeted manner to a specific dataset. Across all backbones, we observe that training on a single EM dataset yields good segmentation performance (quantified as foreground Intersection-over-Union), and that LoRA consistently improves in-domain performance. In contrast, training on multiple EM datasets leads to severe performance degradation for all models considered, with only marginal gains from PEFT. Exploration of the latent representation space through various techniques (PCA, Fréchet Dinov2 distance, and linear probes) reveals a pronounced and persistent domain mismatch between the two considered EM datasets in spite of their visual similarity, which is consistent with the observed failure of paired training. These results suggest that, while VFMs can deliver competitive results for EM segmentation within a single domain under lightweight adaptation, current PEFT strategies are insufficient to obtain a single robust model across heterogeneous EM datasets without additional domain-alignment mechanisms."}

This paper investigates how vision-language representations support driving scene safety assessment and decision-making when integrated into perception, prediction, and planning pipelines. We study three complementary system-level use cases. First, we introduce a lightweight, category-agnostic hazard screening approach leveraging CLIP-based image-text similarity to produce a low-latency semantic hazard signal. This enables robust detection of diverse and out-of-distribution road hazards without explicit object detection or visual question answering. Second, we examine the integration of scene-level vision-language embeddings into a transformer-based trajectory planning framework using the Waymo Open Dataset. Our results show that naively conditioning planners on global embeddings does not improve trajectory accuracy, highlighting the importance of representation-task alignment and motivating the development of task-informed extraction methods for safety-critical planning. Third, we investigate natural language as an explicit behavioral constraint on motion planning using the doScenes dataset. In this setting, passenger-style instructions grounded in visual scene elements suppress rare but severe planning failures and improve safety-aligned behavior in ambiguous scenarios. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that vision-language representations hold significant promise for autonomous driving safety when used to express semantic risk, intent, and behavioral constraints.

Second, we introduce a neighborhood-aware structural distillation strategy to constrain the student's local decision structure. PAND consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on four FGVC benchmarks. Notably, our ResNet-18 student achieves 76.09% accuracy on CUB-200, surpassing the strong baseline VL2Lite by 3.4%.

In this paper, we present an efficient learning-free 4D Gaussian segmentation framework that lifts video segmentation masks to 4D spaces, whose core is a two-stage iterative boundary refinement, TIBR4D. The first stage is an Iterative Gaussian Instance Tracing (IGIT) at the temporal segment level. It progressively refines Gaussian-to-instance probabilities through iterative tracing, and extracts corresponding Gaussian point clouds that better handle occlusions and preserve completeness of object structures compared to existing one-shot threshold-based methods. The second stage is a frame-wise Gaussian Rendering Range Control (RCC) via suppressing highly uncertain Gaussians near object boundaries while retaining their core contributions for more accurate boundaries. Furthermore, a temporal segmentation merging strategy is proposed for IGIT to balance identity consistency and dynamic awareness. Longer segments enforce stronger multi-frame constraints for stable identities, while shorter segments allow identity changes to be captured promptly. Experiments on HyperNeRF and Neu3D demonstrate that our method produces accurate object Gaussian point clouds with clearer boundaries and higher efficiency compared to SOTA methods."}

While recent work has identified structured, human-like conceptual representations within these models, it remains unclear whether they functionally rely on such representations for reasoning. Here we investigate the internal processing of LLMs during in-context concept inference. Our results reveal a conceptual subspace emerging in middle to late layers, whose representational structure persists across contexts. Using causal mediation analyses, we demonstrate that this subspace is not merely an epiphenomenon but is functionally central to model predictions, establishing its causal role in inference. We further identify a layer-wise progression where attention heads in early-to-middle layers integrate contextual cues to construct and refine the subspace, which is subsequently leveraged by later layers to generate predictions. Together, these findings provide evidence that LLMs dynamically construct and use structured, latent representations in context for inference, offering insights into the computational processes underlying flexible adaptation."}

In contrast, most generic object tracking (GOT) methods primarily rely on 2D features of the target and its surroundings while neglecting 3D geometric cues, which makes them susceptible to partial occlusion, distractors, and variations in geometry and appearance. To address this limitation, we introduce GOT-Edit, an online cross-modality model editing approach that integrates geometry-aware cues into a generic object tracker from a 2D video stream. Our approach leverages features from a pre-trained Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer to enable geometric cue inference from only a few 2D images. To tackle the challenge of seamlessly combining geometry and semantics, GOT-Edit performs online model editing with null-space constrained updates that incorporate geometric information while preserving semantic discrimination, yielding consistently better performance across diverse scenarios. Extensive experiments on multiple GOT benchmarks demonstrate that GOT-Edit achieves superior robustness and accuracy, particularly under occlusion and clutter, establishing a new paradigm for combining 2D semantics with 3D geometric reasoning for generic object tracking."}

However, existing methods remain inefficient, suffer from weak localization, and adhere to rigid workflows. To solve these issues, we propose VideoTemp-o3, a unified agentic thinking-with-videos framework that jointly models video grounding and question answering. VideoTemp-o3 exhibits strong localization capability, supports on-demand clipping, and can refine inaccurate localizations. Specifically, in the supervised fine-tuning stage, we design a unified masking mechanism that encourages exploration while preventing noise. For reinforcement learning, we introduce dedicated rewards to mitigate reward hacking. Besides, from the data perspective, we develop an effective pipeline to construct high-quality long video grounded QA data, along with a corresponding benchmark for systematic evaluation across various video durations. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves remarkable performance on both long video understanding and grounding."}

Existing methods typically rely on a single Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) to model temporal deformations, and they often struggle to capture complex point motions and fine-grained dynamic details consistently over time, especially from sparse input views. Our approach, FLAG-4D, overcomes this by employing a dual-deformation network that dynamically warps a canonical set of 3D Gaussians over time into new positions and anisotropic shapes. This dual-deformation network consists of an Instantaneous Deformation Network (IDN) for modeling fine-grained, local deformations and a Global Motion Network (GMN) for capturing long-range dynamics, refined through mutual learning. To ensure these deformations are both accurate and temporally smooth, FLAG-4D incorporates dense motion features from a pretrained optical flow backbone. We fuse these motion cues from adjacent timeframes and use a deformation-guided attention mechanism to align this flow information with the current state of each evolving 3D Gaussian. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FLAG-4D achieves higher-fidelity and more temporally coherent reconstructions with finer detail preservation than state-of-the-art methods."}

Layer-wise pruning, a commonly employed strategy to mitigate inference costs, can partially address this challenge. However, existing approaches generally depend on static heuristic rules and fail to account for the interdependencies among layers, thereby limiting the effectiveness of the pruning process. To this end, this paper proposes a game-theoretic framework that formulates layer pruning as a cooperative game in which each layer acts as a player and model performance serves as the utility. As computing exact Shapley values is computationally infeasible for large language models (LLMs), we propose using a lightweight surrogate network to estimate layer-wise marginal contributions. This network can predict LLM performance for arbitrary layer combinations at a low computational cost. Additionally, we employ stratified Monte Carlo mask sampling to further reduce the cost of Sharpley value estimation. This approach captures inter-layer dependencies and dynamically identifies critical layers for pruning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the consistent superiority of our method in terms of perplexity and zero-shot accuracy, achieving more efficient and effective layer-wise pruning for large language models."}

To address this issue, we propose SemiNFT, a Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based retouching framework that mirrors the trajectory of human artistic training: beginning with rigid imitation and evolving into intuitive creation. Specifically, SemiNFT is first taught with paired triplets to acquire basic structural preservation and color mapping skills, and then advanced to reinforcement learning (RL) on unpaired data to cultivate nuanced aesthetic perception. Crucially, during the RL stage, to prevent catastrophic forgetting of old skills, we design a hybrid online-offline reward mechanism that anchors aesthetic exploration with structural review. % experiments Extensive experiments show that SemiNFT not only outperforms state-of-the-art methods on standard preset transfer benchmarks but also demonstrates remarkable intelligence in zero-shot tasks, such as black-and-white photo colorization and cross-domain (anime-to-photo) preset transfer.

A Comparative Study on the Cross-Lingual Transfer of Composite Harms", "comment": "Accepted at the AICS Workshop, AAAI 2026", "summary": "Most safety evaluations of large language models (LLMs) remain anchored in English. Translation is often used as a shortcut to probe multilingual behavior, but it rarely captures the full picture, especially when harmful intent or structure morphs across languages. Some types of harm survive translation almost intact, while others distort or disappear. To study this effect, we introduce CompositeHarm, a translation-based benchmark designed to examine how safety alignment holds up as both syntax and semantics shift. It combines two complementary English datasets, AttaQ, which targets structured adversarial attacks, and MMSafetyBench, which covers contextual, real-world harms, and extends them into six languages: English, Hindi, Assamese, Marathi, Kannada, and Gujarati. Using three large models, we find that attack success rates rise sharply in Indic languages, especially under adversarial syntax, while contextual harms transfer more moderately. To ensure scalability and energy efficiency, our study adopts lightweight inference strategies inspired by edge-AI design principles, reducing redundant evaluation passes while preserving cross-lingual fidelity. This design makes large-scale multilingual safety testing both computationally feasible and environmentally conscious.

This work presents WiFlow, a novel framework for continuous human pose estimation using WiFi signals. Unlike vision-based approaches such as two-dimensional deep residual networks that treat Channel State Information (CSI) as images, WiFlow employs an encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder captures spatio-temporal features of CSI using temporal and asymmetric convolutions, preserving the original sequential structure of signals. It then refines keypoint features of human bodies to be tracked and capture their structural dependencies via axial attention. The decoder subsequently maps the encoded high-dimensional features into keypoint coordinates. Trained on a self-collected dataset of 360,000 synchronized CSI-pose samples from 5 subjects performing continuous sequences of 8 daily activities, WiFlow achieves a Percentage of Correct Keypoints (PCK) of 97.00% at a threshold of 20% (PCK@20) and 99.48% at PCK@50, with a mean per-joint position error of 0.008m.

However, existing methods remain limited to relatively simple editing operations, hindering real-world applications that require complex and compositional instructions. In this work, we address these limitations from the perspectives of architectural design, data, and evaluation protocols. Specifically, we identify two key challenges in current models: insufficient instruction compliance and background inconsistency. To this end, we propose MCIE-E1, a Multimodal Large Language Model-Driven Complex Instruction Image Editing method that integrates two key modules: a spatial-aware cross-attention module and a background-consistent cross-attention module. The former enhances instruction-following capability by explicitly aligning semantic instructions with spatial regions through spatial guidance during the denoising process, while the latter preserves features in unedited regions to maintain background consistency. To enable effective training, we construct a dedicated data pipeline to mitigate the scarcity of complex instruction-based image editing datasets, combining fine-grained automatic filtering via a powerful MLLM with rigorous human validation. Finally, to comprehensively evaluate complex instruction-based image editing, we introduce CIE-Bench, a new benchmark with two new evaluation metrics. Experimental results on CIE-Bench demonstrate that MCIE-E1 consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative assessments, achieving a 23.96% improvement in instruction compliance."}

However, it still needs to be determined how to apply ML to areas with mathematical constraints, like solving PDEs. Among various approaches to applying ML techniques to solving PDEs, the data-driven discretization method presents a promising way of accelerating and improving existing PDE solver on structured grids where it predicts the coefficients of quasi-linear stencils for computing values or derivatives of a function at given positions. It can improve the accuracy and stability of low-resolution simulation compared with using traditional finite difference or finite volume schemes. Meanwhile, it can also benefit from traditional numerical schemes like achieving conservation law by adapting finite volume type formulations. In this thesis, we have implemented the shallow water equation and Euler equation classic solver under a different framework. Experiments show that our classic solver performs much better than the Pyclaw solver. Then we propose four different deep neural networks for the ML-based solver. The results indicate that two of these approaches could output satisfactory solutions."}

Existing vision-based occupancy forecasting methods focus on motion-related categories such as static and dynamic objects, while semantic information remains largely absent.

This makes current methods sensitive to error accumulation and prevents learning spatio-temporal features directly from images. In this work, we present ForecastOcc, the first framework for vision-based semantic occupancy forecasting that jointly predicts future occupancy states and semantic categories. Our framework yields semantic occupancy forecasts for multiple horizons directly from past camera images, without relying on externally estimated maps. We evaluate ForecastOcc in two complementary settings: multi-view forecasting on the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset and monocular forecasting on SemanticKITTI, where we establish the first benchmark for this task. We introduce the first baselines by adapting two 2D forecasting modules within our framework. Importantly, we propose a novel architecture that incorporates a temporal cross-attention forecasting module, a 2D-to-3D view transformer, a 3D encoder for occupancy prediction, and a semantic occupancy head for voxel-level forecasts across multiple horizons. Extensive experiments on both datasets show that ForecastOcc consistently outperforms baselines, yielding semantically rich, future-aware predictions that capture scene dynamics and semantics critical for autonomous driving."}

Artificial general intelligence is, at its core, a compression problem. Effective compression demands resonance: deep learning scales best when its architecture aligns with the fundamental structure of the data. These are the fundamental principles. Yet, modern vision architectures have strayed from these truths: visual signals are highly redundant, while discriminative information, the surprise, is sparse. Current models process dense pixel grids uniformly, wasting vast compute on static background rather than focusing on the predictive residuals that define motion and meaning. We argue that to solve visual understanding, we must align our architectures with the information-theoretic principles of video, i.e., Codecs.\n  Method. OneVision-Encoder encodes video by compressing predictive visual structure into semantic meaning. By adopting Codec Patchification, OV-Encoder abandons uniform computation to focus exclusively on the 3.1%-25% of regions rich in signal entropy. To unify spatial and temporal reasoning under irregular token layouts, OneVision-Encoder employs a shared 3D RoPE and is trained with a large-scale cluster discrimination objective over more than one million semantic concepts, jointly capturing object permanence and motion dynamics.\n  Evidence. The results validate our core hypothesis: efficiency and accuracy are not a trade-off; they are positively correlated. When integrated into LLM, it consistently outperforms strong vision backbones such as Qwen3-ViT and SigLIP2 across 16 image, video, and document understanding benchmarks, despite using substantially fewer visual tokens and pretraining data. Notably, on video understanding tasks, OV-Encoder achieves an average improvement of 4.1% over Qwen3-ViT. Codec-aligned, patch-level sparsity is a foundational principle, enabling OV-Encoder as a scalable engine for next-generation visual generalists."}

Existing VLLMs acceleration frameworks usually compress spatial and temporal redundancy independently, which overlooks the spatiotemporal relationships, thereby leading to suboptimal spatiotemporal compression. The highly correlated visual features are likely to change in spatial position, scale, orientation, and other attributes over time due to the dynamic nature of video. Building on this insight, we introduce FlashVID, a training-free inference acceleration framework for VLLMs. Specifically, FlashVID utilizes Attention and Diversity-based Token Selection (ADTS) to select the most representative tokens for basic video representation, then applies Tree-based Spatiotemporal Token Merging (TSTM) for fine-grained spatiotemporal redundancy elimination. Extensive experiments conducted on three representative VLLMs across five video understanding benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our method. Notably, by retaining only 10% of visual tokens, FlashVID preserves 99.1% of the performance of LLaVA-OneVision. Consequently, FlashVID can serve as a training-free and plug-and-play module for extending long video frames, which enables a 10x increase in video frame input to Qwen2.5-VL, resulting in a relative improvement of 8.6% within the same computational budget.

In this paper, we present an innovative video decomposition strategy that incorporates view-independent and view-dependent components to enhance the performance of LLVE. The framework is called View-aware Low-light Video Enhancement (VLLVE). We leverage dynamic cross-frame correspondences for the view-independent term (which primarily captures intrinsic appearance) and impose a scene-level continuity constraint on the view-dependent term (which mainly describes the shading condition) to achieve consistent and satisfactory decomposition results. To further ensure consistent decomposition, we introduce a dual-structure enhancement network featuring a cross-frame interaction mechanism. By supervising different frames simultaneously, this network encourages them to exhibit matching decomposition features. This mechanism can seamlessly integrate with encoder-decoder single-frame networks, incurring minimal additional parameter costs. Building upon VLLVE, we propose a more comprehensive decomposition strategy by introducing an additive residual term, resulting in VLLVE++. This residual term can simulate scene-adaptive degradations, which are difficult to model using a decomposition formulation for common scenes, thereby further enhancing the ability to capture the overall content of videos. In addition, VLLVE++ enables bidirectional learning for both enhancement and degradation-aware correspondence refinement (end-to-end manner), effectively increasing reliable correspondences while filtering out incorrect ones. Notably, VLLVE++ demonstrates strong capability in handling challenging cases, such as real-world scenes and videos with high dynamics.

In this work, we present the first mechanistic analysis of VLM adaptation. Using stage-wise model diffing, a technique that isolates representational changes introduced during multimodal fine-tuning, we reveal how a language model learns to \"see\". We first identify vision-preferring features that emerge or reorient during fine-tuning. We then show that a selective subset of these features reliably encodes spatial relations, revealed through controlled shifts to spatial prompts. Finally, we trace the causal activation of these features to a small group of attention heads. Our findings show that stage-wise model diffing reveals when and where spatially grounded multimodal features arise. It also provides a clearer view of modality fusion by showing how visual grounding reshapes features that were previously text-only. This methodology enhances the interpretability of multimodal training and provides a foundation for understanding and refining how pretrained language models acquire vision-grounded capabilities."}

For instance, when estimating the poses and shapes of objects in the scene and importing the resulting estimates into a simulator, small errors might translate to implausible configurations including object interpenetration or unstable equilibrium. This makes it difficult to predict the dynamic behavior of the scene using a digital twin, an important step in simulation-based planning and control of contact-rich behaviors. In this paper, we posit that object pose and shape estimation requires reasoning holistically over the scene (instead of reasoning about each object in isolation), accounting for object interactions and physical plausibility. Towards this goal, our first contribution is Picasso, a physics-constrained reconstruction pipeline that builds multi-object scene reconstructions by considering geometry, non-penetration, and physics. Picasso relies on a fast rejection sampling method that reasons over multi-object interactions, leveraging an inferred object contact graph to guide samples. Second, we propose the Picasso dataset, a collection of 10 contact-rich real-world scenes with ground truth annotations, as well as a metric to quantify physical plausibility, which we open-source as part of our benchmark. Finally, we provide an extensive evaluation of Picasso on our newly introduced dataset and on the YCB-V dataset, and show it largely outperforms the state of the art while providing reconstructions that are both physically plausible and more aligned with human intuition."}

In deployed platforms, this raises copyright and intellectual-property risks and calls for reliable protection. However, existing countermeasures either require costly weight editing as new styles emerge or rely on an explicitly specified editing style, limiting their practicality for deployment-side safety. To address this challenge, we propose DICE (Disentanglement of artist Style from Content via Contrastive Subspace Decomposition), a training-free framework for on-the-fly artist style erasure. Unlike style editing that require an explicitly specified replacement style, DICE performs style purification, removing the artist's characteristics while preserving the user-intended content. Our core insight is that a model cannot truly comprehend the artist style from a single text or image alone. Consequently, we abandon the traditional paradigm of identifying style from isolated samples. Instead, we construct contrastive triplets to compel the model to distinguish between style and non-style features in the latent space. By formalizing this disentanglement process as a solvable generalized eigenvalue problem, we achieve precise identification of the style subspace. Furthermore, we introduce an Adaptive Attention Decoupling Editing strategy dynamically assesses the style concentration of each token and performs differential suppression and content enhancement on the QKV vectors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DICE achieves a superior balance between the thoroughness of style erasure and the preservation of content integrity. DICE introduces an additional overhead of only 3 seconds to disentangle style, providing a practical and efficient technique for curbing style mimicry."}

They then further estimate the material and lighting that lead to the observed scene radiance. However, the latter step is highly ambiguous and prior works suffer from inaccurate color and baked shadows in their albedo estimation albeit their regularization. To this end, we propose RotLight, a simple capturing setup, to address the ambiguity. Compared to a usual capture, RotLight only requires the object to be rotated several times during the process. We show that as few as two rotations is effective in reducing artifacts. To further improve 2DGS-based inverse rendering, we additionally introduce a proxy mesh that not only allows accurate incident light tracing, but also enables a residual constraint and improves global illumination handling. We demonstrate with both synthetic and real world datasets that our method achieves superior albedo estimation while keeping efficient computation."}

Deliberation follows a consistent trajectory: an exploration phase where probability mass spreads across candidates, tentative commitment to a frontrunner, and either convergence or backtracking. Backtracking is prevalent (32% of instances), beneficial (34% accuracy gain over non-backtracking instances), and predominantly directed away from the semantically closest distractor toward the correct answer.

Accurate classification of these movements requires sensing technologies capable of capturing rapid dynamics without distortion. Event cameras, also known as Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS), provide asynchronous recordings of changes in light intensity, thereby eliminating motion blur inherent in conventional frame-based cameras and offering superior temporal resolution and data efficiency. In this study, we introduce a synthetic dataset generated with Blender to simulate saccades and fixations under controlled conditions. Leveraging Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), we evaluate its robustness by training two architectures and finetuning on real event data. The proposed models achieve up to 0.83 accuracy and maintain consistent performance across varying temporal resolutions, demonstrating stability in eye movement classification.

Reducing these artifacts is critical for high-quality imaging. We propose a computationally efficient hybrid deep-learning framework that combines the strengths of 2D and 3D models. First, a 2D U-Net operates on individual slices of undersampled CT volumes to extract feature maps. These slice-wise feature maps are then stacked across the volume and used as input to a 3D decoder, which utilizes contextual information across slices to predict an artifact-free 3D CT volume. The proposed two-stage approach balances the computational efficiency of 2D processing with the volumetric consistency provided by 3D modeling. The results show substantial improvements in inter-slice consistency in coronal and sagittal direction with low computational overhead.

Recent work proposed several visual jailbreak attacks using single/ holistic images. However, contemporary VLMs demonstrate strong robustness against such attacks due to extensive safety alignment through preference optimization (e.g., RLHF). In this work, we identify a new vulnerability: while VLM pretraining and instruction tuning generalize well to split-image inputs, safety alignment is typically performed only on holistic images and does not account for harmful semantics distributed across multiple image fragments. Consequently, VLMs often fail to detect and refuse harmful split-image inputs, where unsafe cues emerge only after combining images. We introduce novel split-image visual jailbreak attacks (SIVA) that exploit this misalignment. Unlike prior optimization-based attacks, which exhibit poor black-box transferability due to architectural and prior mismatches across models, our attacks evolve in progressive phases from naive splitting to an adaptive white-box attack, culminating in a black-box transfer attack. Our strongest strategy leverages a novel adversarial knowledge distillation (Adv-KD) algorithm to substantially improve cross-model transferability. Evaluations on three state-of-the-art modern VLMs and three jailbreak datasets demonstrate that our strongest attack achieves up to 60% higher transfer success than existing baselines. Lastly, we propose efficient ways to address this critical vulnerability in the current VLM safety alignment."}

Although recent advances have shown that pseudo-labeling strategies can be effective, they often fail in fine-grained scenarios due to subtle inter-class similarities. A critical but underexplored issue is the presence of asymmetric and dynamic class confusion, where visually similar classes are unequally and inconsistently misclassified by the source model. Existing methods typically ignore such confusion patterns, leading to noisy pseudo-labels and poor target discrimination. To address this, we propose CLIP-Guided Alignment(CGA), a novel framework that explicitly models and mitigates class confusion in SFDA. Generally, our method consists of three parts: (1) MCA: detects first directional confusion pairs by analyzing the predictions of the source model in the target domain; (2) MCC: leverages CLIP to construct confusion-aware textual prompts (e.g. a truck that looks like a bus), enabling more context-sensitive pseudo-labeling; and (3) FAM: builds confusion-guided feature banks for both CLIP and the source model and aligns them using contrastive learning to reduce ambiguity in the representation space. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate that CGA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art SFDA methods, with especially notable gains in confusion-prone and fine-grained scenarios. Our results highlight the importance of explicitly modeling inter-class confusion for effective source-free adaptation. Our code can be find at https://github.com/soloiro/CGA"}

Prior works on dialogue summary evaluation largely ignore the complexities specific to this task: (i) shift in structure, from multiple speakers discussing information in a scattered fashion across several turns, to a summary's sentences, and (ii) shift in narration viewpoint, from speakers' first/second-person narration, standardized third-person narration in the summary. In this work, we introduce our framework DIALSUMMER to address the above. We propose DIAL-SUMMER's taxonomy of errors to comprehensively evaluate dialogue summaries at two hierarchical levels: DIALOGUE-LEVEL that focuses on the broader speakers/turns, and WITHIN-TURN-LEVEL that focuses on the information talked about inside a turn. We then present DIAL-SUMMER's dataset composed of dialogue summaries manually annotated with our taxonomy's fine-grained errors. We conduct empirical analyses of these annotated errors, and observe interesting trends (e.g., turns occurring in middle of the dialogue are the most frequently missed in the summary, extrinsic hallucinations largely occur at the end of the summary). We also conduct experiments on LLM-Judges' capability at detecting these errors, through which we demonstrate the challenging nature of our dataset, the robustness of our taxonomy, and the need for future work in this field to enhance LLMs' performance in the same.

Cognitive studies suggest that humans address such tasks through two mechanisms: cross-view correspondence, which identifies regions across different views that correspond to the same physical locations, and stepwise viewpoint transformation, which composes relative viewpoint changes sequentially. However, existing studies incorporate these mechanisms only partially and often implicitly, without explicit supervision for both. We propose Human-Aware Training for Cross-view correspondence and viewpoint cHange (HATCH), a training framework with two complementary objectives: (1) Patch-Level Spatial Alignment, which encourages patch representations to align across views for spatially corresponding regions, and (2) Action-then-Answer Reasoning, which requires the model to generate explicit viewpoint transition actions before predicting the final answer. Experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that HATCH consistently outperforms baselines of comparable size by a clear margin and achieves competitive results against much larger models, while preserving single-image reasoning capabilities."}

Through layer-wise analysis, we attribute this failure to a parametric suppression phenomenon: specifically, in deep layers, certain FFN layers overwrite context-sensitive representations with memorized priors. To address this, we propose CoRect (Context-Aware Logit Contrast for Hidden State Rectification). By contrasting logits from contextualized and non-contextualized forward passes, CoRect identifies layers that exhibit high parametric bias without requiring ground-truth labels. It then rectifies the hidden states to preserve evidence-grounded information. Across question answering (QA) and summarization benchmarks, CoRect consistently improves faithfulness and reduces hallucinations compared to strong baselines."}

We identify this limitation as a consequence of globally conditioned velocity fields and joint attention mechanisms, which entangle concurrent edits. To address this issue, we introduce Instance-Disentangled Attention, a mechanism that partitions joint attention operations, enforcing binding between instance-specific textual instructions and spatial regions during velocity field estimation. We evaluate our approach on both natural image editing and a newly introduced benchmark of text-dense infographics with region-level editing instructions. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach promotes edit disentanglement and locality while preserving global output coherence, enabling single-pass, instance-level editing."}

To fill this gap, we introduce the first conceptual and methodological framework for unintended CUA behaviors, by defining their key characteristics, automatically eliciting them, and analyzing how they arise from benign inputs. We propose AutoElicit: an agentic framework that iteratively perturbs benign instructions using CUA execution feedback, and elicits severe harms while keeping perturbations realistic and benign. Using AutoElicit, we surface hundreds of harmful unintended behaviors from state-of-the-art CUAs such as Claude 4.5 Haiku and Opus. We further evaluate the transferability of human-verified successful perturbations, identifying persistent susceptibility to unintended behaviors across various other frontier CUAs.

Recent work addresses this by augmenting reasoning with world models for visual imagination, but questions such as when imagination is actually necessary, how much of it is beneficial, and when it becomes harmful, remain poorly understood. In practice, indiscriminate imagination can increase computation and even degrade performance by introducing misleading evidence. In this work, we present an in-depth analysis of test-time visual imagination as a controllable resource for spatial reasoning. We study when static visual evidence is sufficient, when imagination improves reasoning, and how excessive or unnecessary imagination affects accuracy and efficiency. To support this analysis, we introduce AVIC, an adaptive test-time framework with world models that explicitly reasons about the sufficiency of current visual evidence before selectively invoking and scaling visual imagination. Across spatial reasoning benchmarks (SAT, MMSI) and an embodied navigation benchmark (R2R), our results reveal clear scenarios where imagination is critical, marginal, or detrimental, and show that selective control can match or outperform fixed imagination strategies with substantially fewer world-model calls and language tokens. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of analyzing and controlling test-time imagination for efficient and reliable spatial reasoning."}

However, electrical arcing at this interface poses serious risks, including accelerated wear of contact components, degraded system performance, and potential service disruptions. Detecting arcing events at the pantograph-catenary interface is challenging due to their transient nature, noisy operating environment, data scarcity, and the difficulty of distinguishing arcs from other similar transient phenomena. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multimodal framework that combines high-resolution image data with force measurements to more accurately and robustly detect arcing events. First, we construct two arcing detection datasets comprising synchronized visual and force measurements. One dataset is built from data provided by the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB), and the other is derived from publicly available videos of arcing events in different railway systems and synthetic force data that mimic the characteristics observed in the real dataset. Leveraging these datasets, we propose MultiDeepSAD, an extension of the DeepSAD algorithm for multiple modalities with a new loss formulation. Additionally, we introduce tailored pseudo-anomaly generation techniques specific to each data type, such as synthetic arc-like artifacts in images and simulated force irregularities, to augment training data and improve the discriminative ability of the model. Through extensive experiments and ablation studies, we demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms baseline approaches, exhibiting enhanced sensitivity to real arcing events even under domain shifts and limited availability of real arcing observations."}

At the heart of this process is not just the ability to communicate but also the remarkable flexibility in how we can express ourselves. We can express the same thoughts in virtually infinite ways using different words and structures - this ability to rephrase and reformulate expressions is known as paraphrase. Modeling paraphrases is a keystone to meaning in computational language models; being able to construct different variations of texts that convey the same meaning or not shows strong abilities of semantic understanding. If computational language models are to represent meaning, they must understand and control the different aspects that construct the same meaning as opposed to different meanings at a fine granularity. Yet most existing approaches reduce paraphrasing to a binary decision between two texts or to producing a single rewrite of a source, obscuring which linguistic factors are responsible for meaning preservation. In this thesis, I propose that decomposing paraphrases into their constituent linguistic aspects (paraphrase types) offers a more fine-grained and cognitively grounded view of semantic equivalence. I show that even advanced machine learning models struggle with this task. Yet, when explicitly trained on paraphrase types, models achieve stronger performance on related paraphrase tasks and downstream applications. For example, in plagiarism detection, language models trained on paraphrase types surpass human baselines: 89.6% accuracy compared to 78.4% for plagiarism cases from Wikipedia, and 66.5% compared to 55.7% for plagiarism of scientific papers from arXiv.

In professional AI-assisted filmmaking, it is crucial to perform precise, targeted modifications. A cornerstone of this transition is video instance insertion, which requires inserting a specific instance into existing footage while maintaining scene integrity. Unlike traditional video editing, this task demands several requirements: precise spatial-temporal placement, physically consistent scene interaction, and the faithful preservation of original dynamics - all achieved under minimal user effort. In this paper, we propose PISCO, a video diffusion model for precise video instance insertion with arbitrary sparse keyframe control. PISCO allows users to specify a single keyframe, start-and-end keyframes, or sparse keyframes at arbitrary timestamps, and automatically propagates object appearance, motion, and interaction. To address the severe distribution shift induced by sparse conditioning in pretrained video diffusion models, we introduce Variable-Information Guidance for robust conditioning and Distribution-Preserving Temporal Masking to stabilize temporal generation, together with geometry-aware conditioning for realistic scene adaptation. We further construct PISCO-Bench, a benchmark with verified instance annotations and paired clean background videos, and evaluate performance using both reference-based and reference-free perceptual metrics.

Presence-Absence (PA) data provide accurate and noise-free labels, but are costly to obtain and limited in quantity; Presence-Only (PO) data, by contrast, offer broad spatial coverage and rich spatiotemporal distribution, but suffer from severe label noise in negative samples. To address these real-world constraints, this paper proposes a multimodal fusion framework that fully leverages the strengths of both PA and PO data. We introduce an innovative pseudo-label aggregation strategy for PO data based on the geographic coverage of satellite imagery, enabling geographic alignment between the label space and remote sensing feature space. In terms of model architecture, we adopt Swin Transformer Base as the backbone for satellite imagery, utilize the TabM network for tabular feature extraction, retain the Temporal Swin Transformer for time-series modeling, and employ a stackable serial tri-modal cross-attention mechanism to optimize the fusion of heterogeneous modalities. Furthermore, empirical analysis reveals significant geographic distribution shifts between PA training and test samples, and models trained by directly mixing PO and PA data tend to experience performance degradation due to label noise in PO data. To address this, we draw on the mixture-of-experts paradigm: test samples are partitioned according to their spatial proximity to PA samples, and different models trained on distinct datasets are used for inference and post-processing within each partition. Experiments on the GeoLifeCLEF 2025 dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves superior predictive performance in scenarios with limited PA coverage and pronounced distribution shifts."}

The framework segments long inputs into chunks and encodes each chunk into compressed memory representations using a learned compressor. A gating module dynamically selects relevant memory blocks, which are then iteratively processed by a reasoning module with an evolving working memory to solve downstream tasks. The compressor and reasoner are jointly optimized via end-to-end reinforcement learning, while the gating module is trained separately as a classifier.

However, current ways of entire-block pruning suffer from risks of discarding meaningful cues learned in those blocks, leading to substantial performance degradation. As another line of model compression, channel pruning can better preserve performance, while it cannot reduce model depth and is challenged by inconsistent pruning ratios for individual layers. To pursue better model compression and acceleration, this paper proposes \\textbf{FlattenGPT}, a novel way to detect and reduce depth-wise redundancies. By flatting two adjacent blocks into one, it compresses the network depth, meanwhile enables more effective parameter redundancy detection and removal. FlattenGPT allows to preserve the knowledge learned in all blocks, and remains consistent with the original transformer architecture. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlattenGPT enhances model efficiency with a decent trade-off to performance.

Existing methods typically employ coarse-grained attention as a proxy for block importance estimation, but often resort to expensive token-level searching or scoring, resulting in significant selection overhead. In this work, we trace the inaccuracy of standard coarse-grained attention via mean pooling to a theoretical root cause: the interaction between mean pooling and Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE). We prove that mean pooling acts as a low-pass filter that induces destructive interference in high-frequency dimensions, effectively creating a \"blind spot\" for local positional information (e.g., slash patterns). To address this, we introduce Prism, a training-free spectral-aware approach that decomposes block selection into high-frequency and low-frequency branches. By applying energy-based temperature calibration, Prism restores the attenuated positional signals directly from pooled representations, enabling block importance estimation using purely block-level operations, thereby improving efficiency. Extensive evaluations confirm that Prism maintains accuracy parity with full attention while delivering up to $\\mathbf{5.1\\times}$ speedup."}

However, Video MLLMs face high computational costs, particularly in processing numerous video frames as input, which leads to significant attention computation overhead. A straightforward approach to reduce computational costs is to decrease the number of input video frames. However, simply selecting key frames at a fixed frame rate (FPS) often overlooks valuable information in non-key frames, resulting in notable performance degradation. To address this, we propose Text-guided Video Frame Reduction (TiFRe), a framework that reduces input frames while preserving essential video information. TiFRe uses a Text-guided Frame Sampling (TFS) strategy to select key frames based on user input, which is processed by an LLM to generate a CLIP-style prompt. Pre-trained CLIP encoders calculate the semantic similarity between the prompt and each frame, selecting the most relevant frames as key frames. To preserve video semantics, TiFRe employs a Frame Matching and Merging (FMM) mechanism, which integrates non-key frame information into the selected key frames, minimizing information loss. Experiments show that TiFRe effectively reduces computational costs while improving performance on video-language tasks."}

We present Vista, a novel framework for scene-aware streaming video QA that enables efficient and scalable reasoning over continuous video streams. The innovation of Vista can be summarized in three aspects: (1) scene-aware segmentation, where Vista dynamically clusters incoming frames into temporally and visually coherent scene units; (2) scene-aware compression, where each scene is compressed into a compact token representation and stored in GPU memory for efficient index-based retrieval, while full-resolution frames are offloaded to CPU memory; and (3) scene-aware recall, where relevant scenes are selectively recalled and reintegrated into the model input upon receiving a query, enabling both efficiency and completeness. Vista is model-agnostic and integrates seamlessly with a variety of vision-language backbones, enabling long-context reasoning without compromising latency or memory efficiency. Extensive experiments on StreamingBench demonstrate that Vista achieves state-of-the-art performance, establishing a strong baseline for real-world streaming video understanding."}

Our analysis uncovers fundamental density-stratification. Dense regions exhibit geometry-correlated parameters amenable to render-free prediction, while sparse regions show systematic failure across architectures. We formalize this through variance decomposition, demonstrating that visibility heterogeneity creates covariance-dominated coupling between geometric and appearance parameters in sparse regions. This reveals the dual character of RORs: geometric primitives where point clouds suffice, and view synthesis primitives where multi-view constraints are essential. We provide density-aware strategies that improve training robustness and discuss architectural implications for systems that adaptively balance feed-forward prediction and rendering-based refinement."}

WorldArena assesses models through three dimensions: video perception quality, measured with 16 metrics across six sub-dimensions; embodied task functionality, which evaluates world models as data engines, policy evaluators, and action planners integrating with subjective human evaluation. Furthermore, we propose EWMScore, a holistic metric integrating multi-dimensional performance into a single interpretable index. Through extensive experiments on 14 representative models, we reveal a significant perception-functionality gap, showing that high visual quality does not necessarily translate into strong embodied task capability. WorldArena benchmark with the public leaderboard is released at https://worldarena.ai, providing a framework for tracking progress toward truly functional world models in embodied AI."}

Reducing these artifacts is critical for high-quality imaging. We propose a computationally efficient hybrid deep-learning framework that combines the strengths of 2D and 3D models. First, a 2D U-Net operates on individual slices of undersampled CT volumes to extract feature maps. These slice-wise feature maps are then stacked across the volume and used as input to a 3D decoder, which utilizes contextual information across slices to predict an artifact-free 3D CT volume. The proposed two-stage approach balances the computational efficiency of 2D processing with the volumetric consistency provided by 3D modeling. The results show substantial improvements in inter-slice consistency in coronal and sagittal direction with low computational overhead. This hybrid framework presents a robust and efficient solution for high-quality 3D CT image post-processing.

This limitation is evident from the poor generalization to sports unseen during finetuning. Furthermore, traditional text generation evaluation metrics (e.g., BLEU-4, METEOR, ROUGE-L, BERTScore), originally developed for machine translation and summarization, fail to capture the unique aspects of sports feedback quality. To address the first problem, using rock climbing as our case study, we propose using auxiliary freely-available web data from the target domain, such as competition videos and coaching manuals, in addition to existing sports feedback from a disjoint, source domain to improve sports feedback generation performance on the target domain. To improve evaluation, we propose two evaluation metrics: (1) specificity and (2) actionability. Together, our approach enables more meaningful and practical generation of sports feedback under limited annotations."}

However, electrical arcing at this interface poses serious risks, including accelerated wear of contact components, degraded system performance, and potential service disruptions. Detecting arcing events at the pantograph-catenary interface is challenging due to their transient nature, noisy operating environment, data scarcity, and the difficulty of distinguishing arcs from other similar transient phenomena. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multimodal framework that combines high-resolution image data with force measurements to more accurately and robustly detect arcing events. First, we construct two arcing detection datasets comprising synchronized visual and force measurements. One dataset is built from data provided by the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB), and the other is derived from publicly available videos of arcing events in different railway systems and synthetic force data that mimic the characteristics observed in the real dataset. Leveraging these datasets, we propose MultiDeepSAD, an extension of the DeepSAD algorithm for multiple modalities with a new loss formulation. Additionally, we introduce tailored pseudo-anomaly generation techniques specific to each data type, such as synthetic arc-like artifacts in images and simulated force irregularities, to augment training data and improve the discriminative ability of the model. Through extensive experiments and ablation studies, we demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms baseline approaches, exhibiting enhanced sensitivity to real arcing events even under domain shifts and limited availability of real arcing observations."}

Agreement-based refinement further improves pseudo-label quality. On BraTS 2021, validation DSC increased from 0.393 (10% data) to 0.872 (100%), with the largest gains in early stages, demonstrating data efficiency. The teacher reached a validation DSC of 0.922, and the student surpassed the teacher on tumor subregions (e.g., NCR/NET 0.797 and Edema 0.980); notably, the student recovered the Enhancing class (DSC 0.620) where the teacher failed.

To this end, we propose Raster2Seq, framing floorplan reconstruction as a sequence-to-sequence task in which floorplan elements--such as rooms, windows, and doors--are represented as labeled polygon sequences that jointly encode geometry and semantics. Our approach introduces an autoregressive decoder that learns to predict the next corner conditioned on image features and previously generated corners using guidance from learnable anchors. These anchors represent spatial coordinates in image space, hence allowing for effectively directing the attention mechanism to focus on informative image regions. By embracing the autoregressive mechanism, our method offers flexibility in the output format, enabling for efficiently handling complex floorplans with numerous rooms and diverse polygon structures. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks such as Structure3D, CubiCasa5K, and Raster2Graph, while also demonstrating strong generalization to more challenging datasets like WAFFLE, which contain diverse room structures and complex geometric variations."}

AFlow can estimate intermediate utility over searched trajectories and learn preference-consistent strategy transitions. To improve strategy coherence and empathetic response quality, a subpath-level flow-balance objective is presented to propagate preference signals to intermediate states.

We systematically investigate the performance gap between discrete and continuous methods. Contrary to the belief that discrete tokenizers are intrinsically inferior, we demonstrate that the disparity arises primarily from the total number of bits allocated in the latent space (i.e., the compression ratio). We show that scaling up the codebook size effectively bridges this gap, allowing discrete tokenizers to match or surpass their continuous counterparts. However, existing discrete generation methods struggle to capitalize on this insight, suffering from performance degradation or prohibitive training costs with scaled codebook. To address this, we propose masked Bit AutoRegressive modeling (BAR), a scalable framework that supports arbitrary codebook sizes. By equipping an autoregressive transformer with a masked bit modeling head, BAR predicts discrete tokens through progressively generating their constituent bits. BAR achieves a new state-of-the-art gFID of 0.99 on ImageNet-256, outperforming leading methods across both continuous and discrete paradigms, while significantly reducing sampling costs and converging faster than prior continuous approaches.

To pursue better model compression and acceleration, this paper proposes \\textbf{FlattenGPT}, a novel way to detect and reduce depth-wise redundancies. By flatting two adjacent blocks into one, it compresses the network depth, meanwhile enables more effective parameter redundancy detection and removal. FlattenGPT allows to preserve the knowledge learned in all blocks, and remains consistent with the original transformer architecture. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlattenGPT enhances model efficiency with a decent trade-off to performance.

However, prior work is primarily evaluated on natural-language benchmarks using task-level metrics, where token-level difficulty is unobservable and confounded with architectural factors, making it unclear whether compute allocation truly aligns with underlying complexity. We address this gap through three contributions. First, we introduce a complexity-controlled evaluation paradigm using algorithmic and synthetic language tasks with parameterized difficulty, enabling direct testing of token-level compute allocation. Second, we propose ANIRA, a unified recurrent Transformer framework that supports per-token variable-depth computation while isolating compute allocation decisions from other model factors. Third, we use this framework to conduct a systematic analysis of token-level adaptive computation across alignment with complexity, generalization, and decision timing. Our results show that compute allocation aligned with task complexity can emerge without explicit difficulty supervision, but such alignment does not imply algorithmic generalization: models fail to extrapolate to unseen input sizes despite allocating additional computation. We further find that early compute decisions rely on static structural cues, whereas online halting more closely tracks algorithmic execution state."}

We show experimentally, against a number of SOTA baselines, that TRUST is robust against adversarial prompts, preserves generation quality to a significant degree, and is also significantly faster than the SOTA.

In the bottom-up stage, CoTZero extracts atomic visual primitives and incrementally composes them into diverse, structured question-reasoning forms. In the top-down stage, it enforces hierarchical reasoning by using coarse global structure to guide the interpretation of local details and causal relations. In the cognition-aligned training component, built on the synthesized CoT data, we introduce Cognitively Coherent Verifiable Rewards (CCVR) in Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) to further strengthen VLMs' hierarchical reasoning and generalization, providing stepwise feedback on reasoning coherence and factual correctness. Experiments show that CoTZero achieves an F1 score of 83.33 percent on our multi-level semantic inconsistency benchmark with lexical-perturbation negatives, across both in-domain and out-of-domain settings. Ablations confirm that each component contributes to more interpretable and human-aligned visual reasoning."}

Existing methods typically employ coarse-grained attention as a proxy for block importance estimation, but often resort to expensive token-level searching or scoring, resulting in significant selection overhead. In this work, we trace the inaccuracy of standard coarse-grained attention via mean pooling to a theoretical root cause: the interaction between mean pooling and Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE). We prove that mean pooling acts as a low-pass filter that induces destructive interference in high-frequency dimensions, effectively creating a \"blind spot\" for local positional information (e.g., slash patterns). To address this, we introduce Prism, a training-free spectral-aware approach that decomposes block selection into high-frequency and low-frequency branches. By applying energy-based temperature calibration, Prism restores the attenuated positional signals directly from pooled representations, enabling block importance estimation using purely block-level operations, thereby improving efficiency. Extensive evaluations confirm that Prism maintains accuracy parity with full attention while delivering up to $\\mathbf{5.1\\times}$ speedup."}

However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on general domain visual fidelity, leaving the evaluation of state transitions and temporal coherence in GUI-specific contexts underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce GEBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating dynamic interaction and temporal coherence in GUI generation. GEBench comprises 700 carefully curated samples spanning five task categories, covering both single-step interactions and multi-step trajectories across real-world and fictional scenarios, as well as grounding point localization. To support systematic evaluation, we propose GE-Score, a novel five-dimensional metric that assesses Goal Achievement, Interaction Logic, Content Consistency, UI Plausibility, and Visual Quality. Extensive evaluations on current models indicate that while they perform well on single-step transitions, they struggle significantly with maintaining temporal coherence and spatial grounding over longer interaction sequences. Our findings identify icon interpretation, text rendering, and localization precision as critical bottlenecks. This work provides a foundation for systematic assessment and suggests promising directions for future research toward building high-fidelity generative GUI environments.
